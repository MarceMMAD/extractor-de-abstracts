<br><b>Abstract: </b>New forms of online citizen participation in government decision making have been fostered in the United States (U.S.) under the Obama Administration. Use of Web information technologies have been encouraged in an effort to create more back-and-forth communication between citizens and their government. These "Civic Participation 2.0" attempts to open the government up to broader public participation are based on three pillars of open government---transparency, participation, and collaboration. Thus far, the Administration has modeled Civic Participation 2.0 almost exclusively on the Web 2.0 ethos, in which users are enabled to shape the discussion and encouraged to assess the value of its content. We argue that strict adherence to the Web 2.0 model for citizen participation in public policymaking can produce "participation" that is unsatisfactory to both government decisionmakers and public participants. We believe that successful online civic participation design must balance inclusion and "enlightened understanding," one of the core conditions for democratic deliberation. Based on our experience with Regulation Room, an experimental online participation platform trying to broaden meaningful public engagement in the process federal agencies use to make new regulations, we offer specific suggestions on how participation designers can strike the balance between ease of engagement and quality of engagement---and so bring new voices into the policymaking process through participating that counts.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>In recent years, researchers and entrepreneurs have introduced new online services for data collection and analysis, often relying on interactive visualizations to enable mass interaction with data. These sites represent the first step in what looks to be a growing online phenomenon: social data analysis, that is, collective analysis of data supported by social interaction. Engaging crowds of both experts and non-experts in the process of data exploration has applications ranging from political transparency to business intelligence to citizen science. Achieving this vision, however, will require further innovation in the design of systems for collaborative data management.In this talk, I will highlight recent efforts to use the web as a platform for collectively creating, managing, and analyzing data. I will share how web citizens are collaborating with data, and discuss how we might design systems to catalyze social forms of data management and exploration.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>In this poster, we present a mobile crowdsourcing application, called Afya Ya Barabara (AYB) (which means road health in Kiswahili). The application serves 2 major roles: First is to collect and visualize data on road surface conditions in Nairobi. Second role is as a citizen engagement platform to raise awareness on the state of road conditions in Nairobi using Twitter hashtags. The focus of this work is to discuss how AYB is employed to promote citizen engagement. Nairobi is one of the most active cities in East Africa in terms of Twitter usage. This guided our decision to employ Twitter as a social engagement tool. The demand for more systematic citizen engagement and public participation in the governance of developing cities is growing. As government budgets are becoming increasingly tight, new ways of addressing road maintenance problems are required. Public governance in developing countries faces accountability issues that allow corruption and poor service delivery to seethe. Lack of information and citizen engagement perpetuates such tendencies. We propose Afya Ya Barabara as an engagement platform that will expand the capacity of municipalities and its citizens to better monitor road conditions using mobile technology.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>How should citizens and communities interact with and in their city? Leveraging urban resources for civic purposes, such as citizen participation and community engagement, has been gaining interest in HCI. Essentially, citizens can be empowered to be heard and engage the city better through the use of modern technology. Examples of these technologies are mobile phones, public displays, sensor networks, digital art installations, or any other type of urban technology. This workshop seeks to investigate the progress in creating public human interfaces for interactive urban engagement. We wish to discuss issues such as citizen participation in public life and decision-making, informing citizens, and civic engagement in all its various forms.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>In this workshop we will host presentations from researchers performing online experiments and spend a half day helping attendees create experiments using the Volunteer Science platform. Current approaches to online science use new information technologies to collect and processes data and engage citizen scientists across the globe. Programs like Zooniverse, Fold.It, and SciStarter demonstrate the power of recruiting online volunteers as participants and contributors to research. Platforms like Project Implicit and Volunteer Science confirm that a wide range of social scientific research can be conducted with volunteers in online laboratories. In this workshop, a group of scholars with wide-ranging experience in this area will discuss existing and emerging approaches to online experimentation. Participants will learn about designing and running online studies and will be given access to the Volunteer Science research platform (volunteerscience.com) where they will work with researchers to develop, test, and deploy their own online studies.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>The current situation in Russia is characterized by an intensification in civic engagement: there is an increase in citizens' participation in social movements, protests, and various forms of collective action. At the same time, new instruments and mechanisms are being introduced into the organization of civic engagement. Most of them are associated with the development of the Internet, which facilitates communication between members of civic activism.One of these mechanisms is web applications for civil action. These applications make it possible to bring together an unlimited number of persons in order to deal with a variety of social problems. In this respect, it is important to research this form of civic engagement, which is developing in modern Russia and proving to be so effective. Therefore, the aim of this research is to analyze the effectiveness of such web applications in the process of solving problems both on the level of society as a whole and for individual citizens. The analysis of individual applications allows us to reveal the advantages of this kind of cooperation in solving social problems. We propose to evaluate the effectiveness of web applications as a facility of their service to reduce the transaction costs in the search for and analysis of information, and the identification and assessment of possible alternatives in the process of solving both on the level of society as a whole and for individual citizens.In this paper we analyze three major web applications: "Tak prosto!" ("So easy!"), "Nepofigizm" ("Unindifference"), "Tak-tak-tak..." ("Tut tut tut"). Scrutinizing some quantitative indicators, we explore how they operate. These indicators include: website traffic, the number of users involved in social networks, the number of views of discussions and videos created by the web application, and regional coverage. We have used the case-study method with some event-analysis to collect and analyze the data.It is possible to determine the attractiveness and relevance these applications as tools for citizens in solving various problems. Primarily, it must be identified as a new form of cooperation between citizens and non-profit organizations for solving social problems. Taking into account the demand for civic web applications, the ability to significantly reduce the transaction costs of solving the problems of citizens, as well as the growth of users of these web applications, we can speak about the effectiveness of civic applications in Russia.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Local journalism is a vital element for governance and civic engagement in local communities. It not only serves as an accountability mechanism for key local institutions but also enhances communities' problem solving skills by setting important agendas and opening public discussions. However, the Internet is posing serious challenges to local news outlets that lead to a significant reduction of accountability reporting and decreasing revenue. In this paper, we study the challenges and opportunities of local journalism in online communication space. We first observe the status of local journalism in online discourse by analyzing the public attention to local news outlets. Using Twitter to capture online public discourse, the study provides a large-scale quantitative analysis of the public's attention to local journalism. We also explore the potential to promote local journalism with information systems through a real deployment study. We propose a context-specific, decision-oriented design approach for local journalism, and evaluate it using Informed Citizen, a web portal to local journalistic contents of electoral districts.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>This paper presents findings from a series of iterative field studies on the use of interactive, situated digital technologies deployed within a pop-up style format used for the purpose of community engagement. Based on observations, participant interviews, and a focus group with representatives from the local government authority, the contribution of this research is twofold. First, we propose five elements to guide the design of digital pop-up interventions for community engagement. Second, we demonstrate the effectiveness of combining digital interfaces and a physical pop-up within a civic space equipped with a large urban screen to engage wider cross-sections of the public. From that, we derive insights about the utilisation of this approach in attracting the attention of people who do not generally attend traditional community engagement events, and provide a more seamless consultation process by enabling citizens to submit their responses on the spot.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Local governments struggle to engage time poor and seemingly apathetic citizens, as well as the city's young digital natives, the digital locals. This project aims at providing a lightweight, technological contribution towards removing the hierarchy between those who build the city and those who use it. We aim to narrow this gap by enhancing people's experience of physical spaces with digital, civic technologies that are directly accessible within that space. This paper presents the findings of a design trial allowing users to interact with a public screen via their mobile phones. The screen facilitated a feedback platform about a concrete urban planning project by promoting specific questions and encouraging direct, in-situ, real-time responses via SMS and twitter. This new mechanism offers additional benefits for civic participation as it gives voice to residents who otherwise would not be heard. It also promotes a positive attitude towards local governments and gathers information different from more traditional public engagement tools.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Social media technologies provide unique channels to empower youth to become more civically engaged. Puget Sound Off is an online blogging and networking site focused on helping youth connect, collaborate, and take action around local community issues. We performed an evaluation study seeking lessons learned from a real world deployment. We found that a core group of youth became highly engaged with Puget Sound Off, and that both usage and identification with the community was positively correlated with civic engagement. Youth reported an appreciation for the opportunity for meaningful discussion around issues that mattered to them. We found however that growth of Puget Sound Off was slow, in part due to the constraints of deploying to youth in a real world context with concerns about inappropriate use. We end with recommendations for fostering growth and civic engagement in related social media technologies.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>ICT enables peaceful change in communities affected by conflicts, poverty and injustice. In this demo, we illustrate how young people use multimedia, cell phones and the internet to become global citizen s responsible for building secure, productive and just communities at home and around the world. Global Youth Connectivity allows disaffected youth to express thoughts and feelings, while also scaling global citizenship education and civic engagement across borders. Thousands of Middle-Eastern and American youth have exchanged content and discussed online since 2005. Innovations and partnerships should enable Mercy Corps to empower millions more living in extreme vulnerability.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>This paper discusses online participation in Estonia. Even though Estonia's e-government initiatives are often presented as examples for other countries to be followed, this analysis finds high degree of variation in the outcomes. The availability of innovative platforms for online political participation has led to increasing use of internet voting in the last five elections, while they have consistently failed to engage public in the legislative process. Furthermore, the internet voting can be seen as transactional. It has not made substantial contribution to online democratic participation other than making voting more convenient for certain segments of society. The government portal for encouraging citizens to express their views about new laws suffers from both unwillingness of citizens to participate and most ministries to make new laws available.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Participatory sensing is the process whereby individuals and communities use ever-more-capable mobile phones and cloud services to collect and analyze systematic data for use in discovery. The convergence of technology and analytical innovation with a citizenry that is increasingly comfortable using mobile phones and online social networking sets the stage for this technology to dramatically impact many aspects of our daily lives.Participatory sensing can serve as a powerful "make a case" technology to support advocacy and civic engagement. It can provide a framework in which citizens can bring to light a civic bottleneck, hazard, personal-safety concern, cultural asset, or other data relevant to urban and natural-resources planning and services, all using data that are systematic and can be validated (http://whatsinvasive.com.) The same systems can be used as tools for sustainability. For example, individuals and communities can explore their transportation and consumption habits and corporations can promote more sustainable practices among employees (http://peir.cens.ucla.edu and http://biketastic.com.)

<br><b>Abstract: </b>There is a widespread belief that pervasive technologies will encourage and facilitate partnerships between citizens and civic authorities, enabling individuals to play a greater role in civic planning, service delivery and infrastructure management. However, at present sustained use and perceived value of civic engagement technologies remains low because the design space is poorly understood by system developers who focus almost exclusively on empowering citizens rather than adopting an informed, inclusive approach that addresses the needs of both citizens and civic authorities, and helps establish trusted relationships between these different stakeholders. We report on an extensive study of civic engagement in the domain of public infrastructure maintenance and provide insights into the civic management processes to support future design of trusted civic engagement interactions.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>With the availability of displays in public space increasing, they have been proposed and studied as platform for civic engagement. Due to their situated nature, public displays have the potential to enable a larger cross-section of the public to participate in community consultation processes, compared to focus groups or online surveys. Previous research has investigated a range of interaction methods for enabling this form of citizen participation with public displays. Through an analysis of related work we identified four main categories of interaction methods: remote indirect, kiosk, mid-air gestural and mobile. In this paper we propose a formerly introduced interaction method, based upon mobile augmented reality, which promises to enable pervasive participation by making interactions more private and simultaneous, through a familiar and convenient interface.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Civic crowdfunding is a sub-type of crowdfunding whereby citizens contribute to funding community-based projects ranging from physical structures to amenities. Though civic crowdfunding has great potential for impact, it remains a developing field in terms of project success and widespread adoption. To explore how technology shapes interactions and outcomes within civic projects, our research addresses two interrelated questions: how do offline communities engage online across civic crowdfunding projects, and, what purpose does this activity serve both projects and communities? These questions are explored through discussion of types of offline communities and description of online activity across civic crowdfunding projects. We conclude by considering the implications of this knowledge for civic crowdfunding and its continued research.

<br><b>Abstract: </b> Online social networks are now common place in day-to-day lives. They are also increasingly used to drive social action initiatives, either led by government or communities themselves (e.g., SeeClickFix, LoveLewisham.org, mumsnet). However, such initiatives are mainly used for crowd sourcing community views or coordinating activities. With the changing global economic and political landscape, there is an ever pressing need to engage citizens on a large-scale, not only in consultations about systems that affect them, but also involve them directly in the design of these very systems. In this paper we present the UDesignIt platform that combines social media technologies with software engineering concepts to empower communities to discuss and extract high-level design features. It combines natural language processing, feature modelling and visual overlays in the form of ``image clouds'' to enable communities and software engineers alike to unlock the knowledge contained in the unstructured and unfiltered content of social media where people discuss social problems and their solutions. By automatically extracting key themes and presenting them in a structured and organised manner in near real-time, the approach drives a shift towards large-scale engagement of community stakeholders for system design.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>When e-government first became a viable solution to the dissemination of government information, experts believed that the rise of direct government-to-citizen (G2C) services would improve government transparency and foster civic engagement. It soon became clear, however, that not all users were not getting the type of information or instruction that they needed from this arrangement, and that there was a need for an intermediary in this continuum of services. Increasingly, libraries fulfill this role. Instead of direct government-to-user interaction, information channels flow from agency to librarian to user, from user back up to agency, and from agency to user to librarian. This paper expands on the idea of these multiple pathways of information through research conducted in collaboration with libraries, government agencies, state library agencies, and a national library association in the United States with aims to create an e-government web resource to assist librarians engaging in e-government services. The different pathways of information both informed the creation of the web resource and offered a practical model of e-government, important for other projects dealing with similar information.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>There is a growing need in computer science education to develop courses that demonstrate the articulations between computer science and an array of computing-dependent fields. This poster describes an effort to develop a model for students and faculty to collaborate across disciplines and with a community organization to develop computational solutions to address complex real-world problems. Students in computer science classes are collaborating with students in journalism classes and Habitat for Humanity, to develop a web-based system that manages pollution related data. This is an initiative aimed at empowering citizens in the Trenton area of New Jersey with the opportunity to learn, share, and contribute pollution data while encouraging them to become participants in environmental advocacy and public policy deliberations on these issues. While students focus on the objectives of the individual courses, they are also deeply engaged in the complexities of privacy, security, accessibility of data, user-centered design, etc. as they ponder civic justice issues.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>This paper introduces a new experience-driven design concept to public spaces, such as bus stops, to strengthen connections between cities and their citizens. With the prototype described here we are provoking inquiry into whether the "technology" that is a bus stop, with high tech augmentations can engender civic engagement and more interconnected cities. Our preliminary user studies showed that people, while waiting for the bus, do not interact with each other, and as such are "alone together". Our concept is to connect people in the city, and also between two different cities by utilizing their waiting time. "Virtual Garden" creates the experience of "being connected" by providing users with the possibility to "grow" a collaborative garden using a smartphone and natural gestures as the control interaction. Lo-fi prototypes were used to gather user feedback which informed the design of the 'Virtual Garden'.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Your awesome petition app is like a sports car without a freeway to drive on. Over the past several years we've built amazing civic apps that are improving public service delivery, engaging more citizens in the political process, and making governments more accountable around the world. But we're rapidly approaching a point common to all new public technologies: the need for common infrastructure to enable massive scale. This talk will discuss three tenets of civic technology that will take us towards a common framework, and present research and examples of work doing this today. It's time for developers, governments, corporations, academics, funders and citizens to come together and lay the groundwork for what's next.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>In this demo we present IBM Sidewalks, a mobile application designed to facilitate the identification of accessibility issues in a city via crowdsourcing. This application connects to our Citizen Sensing platform, providing to city administrators an integrated view about issues in the city, such as sidewalks that are obstructed or in bad condition. If a representative amount of data is collected through people engagement, a significant number of issues will be registered, and analytics tools can be used to identify the impact these issues have on people with disabilities' lives. Consequently, we can use such information to build accessibility maps, and possibly to define an appropriate action plan to address the issues, optimizing resource allocation.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>For over a century, citizen scientists have volunteered to collect huge quantities of data for professional scientists to analyze. We designed Pathfinder, an online environment that challenges this traditional division of labor by providing tools for citizen scientists to collaboratively discuss and analyze the data they collect. We evaluated Pathfinder in a sustainability and commuting context using a mixed methods approach in both naturalistic and experimental settings. Our results showed that citizen scientists preferred Pathfinder to a standard wiki and were able to go beyond data collection and engage in deeper discussion and analyses. We also found that citizen scientists require special types of technological support because they generate original research. This paper offers an early example of the mutually beneficial relationship between HCI and citizen science.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>This paper describes the Interactions Gallery, a new initiative at British HCI (BHCI) that seeks to bring a 'pop-up' gallery space to an academic conference. Submissions were welcomed from creative practitioners, artists and HCI researchers alike, with the call for work that provokes open discussion about the conference themes -- on the nature of computers in society and the future of human-computer interaction (HCI). More specifically, with Lincoln housing one of only four surviving copies of the Magna Carta the city has taken a major role in the 2015's 800th anniversary celebrations. This anniversary has provided a unique historic backdrop for a conference theming relating to the role interactive technology plays in the enactment of our civic lives. Interactive technologies are increasingly mediating citizens' relationships to their privacy, rights, authority, governance and each other. It therefore seemed fitting to include work for the Interactions Gallery that engages with the concerns of social renewal, activism, democracy, and grassroots innovation. Submitted work was diverse in approach, including fine art, performance, interactive media design, demonstrations and technologically augmented live experiences. The chairs collectively selected pieces based on their thematic relevance and the practical staging requirements of the event setting. Work was documented through the archival publication of abstracts in the conference proceedings.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>When societies experience disruption as caused by natural disasters, various official government agencies, relief organizations, and emergent citizen groups engage in activities that aid in the recovery effort—the process that leads to the resumption of normal life. In war environments however, societal trust can be affected and people may develop distrust of the institutions and associated individuals that provide and resolve breakdowns in infrastructure. This article reports on an ethnographic study of the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) by citizens experiencing ongoing disruption in a conflict zone. We conducted 90 semistructured interviews with Iraqi civilians who experienced the 2nd Gulf War beginning in March 2003. We show how citizens used ICTs to continuously resolve breakdowns in infrastructure during ongoing disruption caused by the conflict, by creating new, reliable technology-mediated social arrangements that enabled people to maintain daily routines for travel, education, and obtaining information. We then discuss new ways to think about infrastructure and implications for the disaster relief effort.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>The modern world is facing global challenges while at the same time becoming more and more interconnected, dynamic and complex in nature. Accordingly, appropriate methods and tools for successful open and collaborative public governance and public policy making supported by innovative ICT are increasingly becoming important. Along the demands for the implementation of good governance principles and the adoption of open government, policy officials need concise and reliable information to conduct policy making in an efficient and effective way. Likewise, the engagement of the citizenry as well as of civil society organisations (CSOs) and of representatives of the business and voluntary sectors have become imperative. In an international and inter-disciplinary researcher network called eGovPoliNet, scholars have developed visionary scenarios to envisage how ICT-supported open and public governance and policy making might emerge in the years to come. We used scenario building as a method to get insights into potential alternative futures in a certain area. The scenarios sketched the interactions, environment, technological developments and other relevant aspects of potential futures of ICT-enabled public governance and how policy modelling could be deployed thereby. From initial 19 scenarios formulated, a final set of six scenarios has been consolidated and exposed to a wider group of experts. Next step in this process is to develop a range of grand challenges and research directions in this field.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>A growing body of research is looking at ways to bring the processes and benefits of online deliberation to the places they are about and in turn allow a larger, targeted proportion of the urban public to have a voice, be heard, and engage in questions of city planning and design. Seeking to take advantage of the civic opportunities of situated engagement through public screens and mobile devices, our research informed a public urban screen content application DIS that we deployed and evaluated in a wide range of real world public and urban environments. For example, it is currently running on the renowned urban screen at Federation Square in Melbourne. We analysed the data from these user studies within a conceptual framework that positions situated engagement across three key parameters: people, content, and location. We propose a way to identify the sweet spot within the nexus of these parameters to help deploy and run interactive systems to maximise the quality of the situated engagement for civic and related deliberation purposes.

However, there are very few descriptions of HCI interventions that have achieved sustained community engagement and social impact. We discuss three tensions that are hindering HCI's capacity to produce both research and social contributions and suggest how to overcome them.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Social media was one of the most influential platforms used by counterparts in many recent contentious political events all over the world. Both the statist and protest groups used web-based social networks for political mobilization during the electoral period of 2011–2012 in Russia. This paper focuses on two basic aspects of political communication in the Russian segment of the Internet. Firstly, it discusses the emergence of pro-elite and protest networks, which aim to mobilize political participation during the electoral period. Secondly, it explores the evolution of such networks within 18 months and offline activity, which is determined by contention on social media. In our survey, we take the pro-elite and protest segments of the Russian social network, "Vkontakte", as an object of analysis. We use network analysis to examine how the network appeared and occurred during the electoral period, as well as how such networks have changed 18 months later. The study of the transformations of the protest segments showed a significant shift in civic engagement. One and a half years after the electoral cycle of 2011–2012, the network protest groups institutionalized in NGOs or, at least, in the civil initiatives of different areas: election observation, anti-corruption activity and local issues, etc.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Shifts in the culture of civic engagement, technologies and practices surrounding social media, and pressure from political leaders have ignited a movement amongst gov't agencies to extend their efforts for obtaining input on public issues. These projects face serious challenges related to scale of participation and political capture, though collaborative efforts elsewhere suggest we may be able to support interactions amongst large numbers of people. Instead of emphasizing the exchange of individual messages and voting, I propose that systems should be designed to support the cooperative production of discussions.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>As communities develop technological literacy and explore how technology can impact their lives, the future of urban computing will come from grass-roots initiatives in addition to traditional top-down urban planning. To this end, we aim to engage the do-it- yourself (DIY) community in exploring how individuals can add technology to their communities. As design probes into this space, we have built prototype devices around off-the-shelf technology, open-ended interactions and simple engineering techniques familiar to the DIY community. Through evolving these devices with both the technical DIY community and Pittsburgh's local communities, we hope to spark citizen-led efforts in bringing novel applications of computing to our communities.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>The need for transformative collaboration among cross-disciplinary stakeholders is becoming paramount since the complexity of designing (intelligent) systems, products and services has increased rapidly the last decade. Inspired by phenomenology, pragmatism and embodied cognition, we explore how we can use embodiment and skilful coping to connect people and to catalyse a constructive design "conversation" among people with different backgrounds (Hummels, 2012). During a two-weeks workshop with Master students at the Dept. of Industrial Design at the Eindhoven University of Technology, we developed six different interactive Engagement Probes: open, creative and playful tools aimed at engaging people in a design process more concrete and effective than a brainstorm session. These Engagement Probes have been validated in a five-hour workshop Hephaestus and the Senses, in which 80 participants from different background have used them as a mean to ignite their design process. Every team started to meet and getting to know each other in a playful way using their bodies through one of the Engagement Probes. Thereupon, they designed and prototyped in teams of 4-6 persons, an artefact for citizens to socially connect through their senses. The results of the workshop show that the Probes stimulate engagement, help people to get familiar and connect in a short period of time, and inspire and boost a design process with an emphasis on embodiment and tangibility (Trotto and Hummels, submitted).

<br><b>Abstract: </b>When the White House National Science and Technology Council laid out a series of grand challenges for disaster reduction, the first was to provide hazard and disaster information where and when it is needed. Earth observation and monitoring capabilities are only as good as their ability to reach those in harm's way and inform those who must respond when disaster strikes. At the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), our scientists work on many different natural hazards across the US and around the globe in close collaboration with federal, state and academic partners. We support monitoring networks, generate hazard assessments, and study the natural processes and societal factors that shape the risks we face from hazard events.The USGS has delegated federal responsibility to provide notifications and warnings for geologic hazards, including earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and landslides. For a number of other hazards, USGS monitoring capabilities support the statutory responsibilities of our partners. Data from USGS national and global seismic networks are fed directly to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tsunami warning centers. USGS streamgages and storm-surge monitors support NOAA's flood and severe weather warnings, including those for hurricanes. The USGS maintains a network of 14 geomagnetic observatories around the US and its territories, which are used by NOAA and the U. S. Air Force to measure the intensity of geomagnetic storms caused by solar flares and other space weather.For earthquakes, the USGS Advanced National Seismic System generates situational awareness tools that include e-mail and text alerts to over 300,000 subscribers worldwide and the Prompt Assessment of Global Earthquakes for Response (PAGER) system's rapid estimates of fatalities and economic losses to help focus and prioritize response. Disaster information has increasingly become a two-way flow thanks to crowdsourcing and social media. The USGS actively engages with the public, who report on what they experienced through our Did You Feel It website. Tens of thousands of these reports come in after widely felt earthquakes, and that citizen science information is then used to augment instrumental data to refine impact estimates.For volcanoes, the USGS is modernizing and expanding its monitoring capabilities through the National Volcano Early Warning System. Common nationwide alerts and notifications characterize the threats to aviation and nearby communities due to unrest and eruptive activity at the 169 active U. S. volcanoes. For landslides, a prototype debris-flow warning system has been established in southern California in partnership with NOAA with plans to expand up the West Coast.USGS geospatial information supports response operations for wildfires and many other types of disasters. The web-based GeoMAC application provides fire managers and increasingly the public with current geospatial information on the status, location, and proximity of wildfires to natural resources, property, and infrastructure. Through its Hazard Data Distribution System, the USGS coordinates the acquisition and provision of satellite imagery and authoritative geospatial information for use in disaster preparations, rescue and relief operations, damage assessments, and reconstruction efforts.Millions of people worldwide look to USGS for rapid, reliable hazard information, either directly or through our partners. We are continually looking for ways to innovate in the face of ever-increasing expectations to deliver the right information to the right people at the right time.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Little is known about the challenges and successes people face when piecing together multiple social media to interact in the online public sphere when: seeking information, disseminating information, and engaging in political discussions. We interviewed 29 US citizens and conducted 17 talk-out-loud sessions with people who were using one or more social media technologies, such as Facebook and Twitter, to interact in the online public sphere. We identified a number of challenges and workarounds related to public sphere interactions, and used our findings to formulate requirements for new political environments that support the interactions in the public sphere. Through evolving requirements generation, we developed a new political deliberation technology, dubbed Poli, which is an integrated social media environment with the potential to enable more effective interactions in the public sphere. We discuss several remaining questions and limitations to our tool that will drive future work.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Fireflies are a unique part of the natural landscape at a global scale. Urban development and changes in the landscape can negatively affect firefly distribution and abundance. Assessment of firefly abundance through counts of bioluminescence flashes provides an environmental quality indicator that can be easily observed and quantified by citizen scientists. Researchers at Clemson University, collaborating with resources managers, educators and teachers initiated the Vanishing Firefly Project to engage citizen scientists with the following goals: (1) Science Inquiry-Engage citizens in scientific practices to understand the impacts of urbanization on environmental quality; (2) Service Learning-Increase the skill of citizens in making critical, scientific and informed decisions through community and service activities; (3) Sustainability-Protect natural habitats through effective land and resource management practices and (4) Stewardship-Provide opportunities for citizens to participate in environmental and sustainability studies and activities.The project began in 2010, and was initially a Field Day located in Georgetown, South Carolina, USA. Since then, the project has grown from a single day event, to a statewide field survey, and now a global event in 2014. The 2010 efforts were local and to realize our goals would require increasing citizen science participation from one location in South Carolina to a regional scale. Several issues were to be addressed that varied from technology development, data quality and management, citizen scientist training and motivation for volunteers. Our initial technology framework consisted of a single Google Docs webform that allowed users to submit their firefly counts, but we had no ability to engage volunteers during and after the initial submission. The technology framework at this time (2014) now consists of an iOS app, Android app and a webform that submit firefly counts, firefly behavior, ambient light measurements (iOS and Android app only) and habitat type to a real-time reporting and geospatial data management system. Our efforts have leveraged social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to support training, education and engagement. This paper describes project activities focusing on how our technology framework has developed and matured to increase the scope, reach and capability of citizen scientists participating in the Vanishing Firefly Project.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Digital citizen science offers a low-cost way to strengthen the scientific infrastructure, and engage members of the public in science. It is based on two pillars:(1)a technological pillar, which involves developing computer systems to manage large amounts of distributed resources, and (2) a motivational pillar, which involves attracting and retaining volunteers who would contribute their skills, time, and effort to a scientific cause. While the technological dimension has been widely studied, the motivational dimension received little attention to date. To address this gap, we surveyed volunteers at Stardust@home a digital citizen science project, in which volunteers classify online images from NASA's Stardust spacecraft. We found that collective and intrinsic motivations are the most salient motivational factors, whereas reward motives seem to be less relevant. We also found that intrinsic and norm-oriented motives are most strongly associated with participation intentions, which were, in turn, found to be associated with participation effort. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Social media can be employed as powerful tools for enabling broad participation in public policy making. However, variations in the design of a social media technology system can lead to different levels or kinds of engagement, including low participation or polarized interchanges. The complex motivations, expectations, and actions among various actors in political communication need to be considered as 'make-or-break' factors in the design of such systems.This paper uses the i* modeling framework to analyse the impact that alternative configurations of a social media technology can have on the goals and relationships of the actors involved. The framework is applied to a website devoted to the deliberation of climate change issues. The intentional qualities that guide the actors in these discussions are derived from a review of the literature on e-government, on means for eliciting citizen opinion, and on the social aspects of online discussion.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>The blogosphere is changing how people experience war and conflict. We conducted an analysis of 125 blogs written by Iraqi citizens experiencing extreme disruption in their country. We used Hoffman's [8] stages of recovery model to understand how blogs support people in a region where conflict is occurring. We found that blogs create a safe virtual environment where people could interact, free of the violence in the physical environment and of the strict social norms of their changing society in wartime. Second, blogs enable a large network of global support through their interactive and personal nature. Third, blogs enable people experiencing a conflict to engage in dialogue with people outside their borders to discuss their situation. We discuss how blogs enable people to collaboratively interpret conflict through communities of interest and discussion with those who comment. We discuss how technology can better support blog use in a global environment.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Three-dimensional digital environments and computer graphics technology accessibility and influence on individuals' life have increased in the last few years. For instance, game technology has influenced children's lifestyle. Due to that we have attempted to use 3D digital technology related to Web-based Virtual Reality to support learning and teaching actions in the context of K-12 Education.In this paper, we present educational actions that we have carried out for improving K-12 children and educators' digital literacy with focus on ongoing work developments and results.We have achieved qualitative results, showing an enormous potential for stimulating individuals' motivation/will and development in places under social and economic disadvantage. The results have been reached through computer supported collaborative and interdisciplinary learning experiences; young children's cognitive and technical skills development for using Web-based Virtual Reality tools and techniques with autonomy; including basic and higher education collaborative work.We have observed an increase on individuals' engagement with technology, which has supported ones' sustainable knowledge based interactions and technical skills improvements in diverse contexts. Citizens' technical knowledge domain has brought about ones' awareness and cultural transformation related to use information and communication resources better as lifelong learning companion as well as approximating individuals from arts, culture, science and contemporary technology.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Social media offers new ways for citizens to discuss and debate politics and engage in the democratic process. These online systems could be places for rich policy relevant debate, which is favored by scholars of deliberative democracy. Alternatively, social media might be a platform for an identity driven form of political discourse that is routinely scorned by scholars of democracy. To examine these two possibilities, we analyzed tweets sent during three national elections, the defining participatory process of democracy. Our dataset includes over 760,000 tweets gathered during national elections in Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya from 2011 to 2013. In order to analyze the degree to which Twitter was being used for policy relevant discussion we developed policy term sets through a text analysis of the major political party platforms. To examine the amount of discourse focused on identity issues we created identity term sets based upon national religious, tribal, and regional differences. In Nigeria, where divisive identity politics feed violence and electoral misconduct, discussion of tribe, region, and religion dominate mentions of platform policies. In contrast Ghanaians, who enjoy the most robust democracy of the three countries, were seven times more likely to discuss policy issues rather than identity. Kenyan democracy is still undergoing consolidation, and tweets again reflect this, with almost as many tweets devoted to tribal identity as campaign policy. These findings suggest that social media discussions may echo the state of democratic deepening found in a country during its national elections.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Citizen science is a form of collaborative research engaging the public with professional scientists. Information and communication technologies (ICT) are a leading factor in the recent spread of this phenomenon. A common assumption is that money and ICT are the ideal solutions to issues of data quality and participant engagement. The reality is instead that resource limitations often require adopting suboptimal ICT, including tools that are "free as in puppies" with hidden costs from poor usability and lack of appropriate functionality.A comparative case study of three citizen science projects, eBird, The Great Sunflower Project, and Mountain Watch, found that projects with few ICT resources employed a broader range of strategies to address these issues than expected. The most practical and effective strategies integrated available ICT with other resources to open up new solutions and options for supporting citizen science outcomes in spite of resource limitations.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>The elderly represent a valid group of users who can potentially benefit greatly from engaging with technology, such as healthcare systems or playing digital games. Yet, less attention has been given to the significance of senior citizens as technology users, as compared to the common younger population. In an effort to fill in the gap, this workshop aims to investigate the design of technology for senior citizens. To provide for more focused, thus more productive discussion, we will use elderly mobile phone games as a case in point here. The overarching objective is to understand what can help to make for better and more meaningful use of interactive applications and technology by the elderly, for instance, games on the mobile phone.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Civic engagement systems to date frequently focus on purely rational aspects of deliberation void of emotions. In order to empower youth in a largely immigrant and lower-income neighborhood, we designed a location-based storytelling and story experiencing system for web-enabled mobile phones. The system is based on a novel concept of pervasive play where stories emerge and develop on several dimensions -- most notably for our design a geographical one. This system functions as a research instrument in this paper. Through a qualitative analysis of the comments made through the system, we find (1) memories, feelings, and attitudes to be prime means of expression for youth, (2) the expression of such personal emotions leading to civic discussions, and (3) such discussions expanding over geographic areas in the neighborhood. Consequently, we argue for an approach to locative civic engagement systems that takes a vantage point in youth's emotions rather than a very rational and dry approach to deliberation.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>The National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) of India aims at making all government services accessible to the citizens through common service delivery outlets. It also seeks to ensure efficiency, transparency, and reliability of such services at affordable costs. A huge nationwide ICT infrastructure comprising of more than one lakh Common Service Centres (CSCs) for approximately six lakh villages, Statewide Area Networks (SWAN) for network connectivity to the lowest administrative levels, and State Data Centres (SDCs) for hosting state level e-Governance applications and data are thus being set up. Government departments, like, Land Records, Police, Property Registration, Agriculture, Employment, Watershed Management, Disaster Management, and local level elected bodies like Panchayats (village clusters) and Municipalities etc. involving geographic information, geo-spatial data and processing tools assume significance.Taking note of this requirement, the Natural Resources Data Management System (NRDMS) programme of Department of Science & Technology (DST), Government of India aims at setting up Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) and developing a suite of web-accessible geo-spatial data processing tools. The SDIs and the tools are expected to provide information support to the efficient delivery of e-services under the NeGP. Research & Development (R & D) in the emerging areas of Geo Information Science and Technology are promoted to continually upgrade the tools and techniques. Some of the thrust areas for R & D include Geo-spatial Cloud Computing, Geo-Service Chaining, Geo-visualisation and Computer Cartography, Geo-Semantic Web, Spatio-temporal Data Modelling, Uncertainty in Geo-Spatial Data, Analytical/Process Modelling and Spatial Data Handling (SDI) etc. Specialized research and training centres are being set up in different parts of the country to facilitate capacity building.Sharing of spatial data by data providing agencies in the framework of Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) is an essential requirement in e-services delivery. District and state geo-portal prototypes have been developed using OGC/ISO specifications and their utility demonstrated to end user agencies. Specific studies have been completed in areas like Cartographic Generalization, Enterprise GIS, and Sensor Web Enablement etc. in order to demonstrate the utility of web-based geo-spatial data processing tools in e-Governance service delivery. In a typical district or a state, different line departments and agencies acquire and process spatial data sets for field/local level applications. Some of these data sets relate to watersheds, plots, weather, irrigation, health, education etc. Inadequate access to these data sets inhibits their use and integration with other relevant layers. The geo-portals are being upgraded with metadata from the line departments to facilitate discovery of geo-spatial data by using catalogue service on web (CSW). The geo-portals have been made accessible through the single window access mechanism of the India Geo Portal of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI).In order to provide map service on the web for a city area primarily consisting of features like buildings and roads, there is a need for generalizing features by removing unnecessary details. Cartographic generalization plays an important role in overcoming these effects and preserves the required legibility considering the need for communicating (maps) geographical data to mobile devices in support of delivery of e-services.In the coming years, NRDMS will gear itself towards covering application sectors like 'Sustainable Agriculture' and 'Disaster Management', and engaging stakeholders attention in the development and utilization of geo-spatial data processing tools and technologies in different real-life applications.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>This paper describes the Community Historians project, which was a series of public, participatory workshops focused on conceptualizing and enacting forms of citizen engagement through technology. The goal of the project was to provide the space and resources to discover, discuss, and document inherent communal values and tangible resources present in a low-income community. The result of the first workshop was an interactive, alternative asset map of the area. The second workshop involved residents building their own digital cameras from component parts. The purpose of these activities was to reinforce critical thought about how technology affected the lives of residents and to empower adaptation of technology as a tool for communal development.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>This experience paper is a personal thinkpiece which outlines many of the main issues and discussions taking place in Europe and elsewhere about the future of the public sector and how it can respond positively to some of the acute challenges it faces in light of the financial crisis and other global challenges. The paper examines how ICT-enabled public sector innovation highlights concepts like open governance, public value, government as a platform, open assets, open services and open engagement. It develops a vision of an 'open governance framework', moving beyond 'new public management', based on ICT-enabled societal-wide collaboration. It recognises that although the public sector can in principle create public value on its own, its potential to do so is greatly enhanced and extended by direct cooperation with other actors, or by facilitating public value creation by other actors on their own. It also examines the role of bottom-up innovation and public policy experimentation, as well as the need to focus on empowering civil servants and changing public sector working practices and mindsets.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Crowdsourcing implies user collaboration and engagement, which fosters a renewal of city governance processes. In this article, we address a subset of crowdsourcing, named citizen-sourcing, where citizens interact with authorities collaboratively and actively. Many systems have experimented citizen-sourcing in city governance processes; however, their maturity levels are mixed. In order to focus on the service maturity, we introduce a city service maturity framework that contains five levels of service support and two levels of information integration. As an example, we introduce CITY FEED, which implements citizen-sourcing in city issue management process. In order to support such process, CITY FEED supports all levels of the maturity framework (publishing, transacting, interacting, collaborating, and evaluating) and integrates related information relationally and heterogeneously. In order to integrate heterogeneous information, it implements a threefold feed deduplication mechanism based on the geographic, text semantic, and image similarities of feeds. Currently, CITY FEED is in a pilot stage.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Online citizen science projects engage volunteers in collecting, analyzing, and curating scientific data. Existing projects have demonstrated the value of using volunteers to collect data, but few projects have reached the full collaborative potential of scientists and volunteers. Understanding the shared and unique motivations of these two groups can help designers establish the technical and social infrastructures needed to promote effective partnerships. We present findings from a study of the motivational factors affecting participation in ecological citizen science projects. We show that volunteers are motivated by a complex framework of factors that dynamically change throughout their cycle of work on scientific projects; this motivational framework is strongly affected by personal interests as well as external factors such as attribution and acknowledgment. Identifying the pivotal points of motivational shift and addressing them in the design of citizen-science systems will facilitate improved collaboration between scientists and volunteers.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Over the last decade, a citizen science movement has tried to engage students, laymen and other non-scientists in the production of science. However, there has been less attention in citizen science projects to use the public to disseminate scientific knowledge. Wikipedia provides a platform to study engagement of citizen scientists in knowledge dissemination. College and university students are especially appropriate members of the public to write science articles, because of the course-work and mentorship they receive from faculty. This paper describes a project to support students' writing of scientific articles in Wikipedia. In collaboration with a scientific association, we involved 640 students from 36 courses in editing scientific articles on Wikipedia. This paper provides details in the design of the program and our quantitative and qualitative approaches to evaluating it. Our results show that the Wikipedia classroom experiment benefits both the Wikipedia community and students. Undergraduate and graduate students substantially improved the scientific content of over 800 articles, at a level of quality indistinguishable from content written by PhD experts. Both students and faculty endorsed the motivational benefits of an authentic writing experience that would be read by thousands of people.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Social entrepreneurship is increasingly seen as a critical component of the global conversation on volunteerism and civic engagement. The purpose of this article is to lay the groundwork for a larger conversation on the role of information technology in social entrepreneurship by summarizing the discussions among participants of a recent conference on the subject. Social networking and information sharing were identified as the most critical roles of IT in support of social entrepreneurship. However, in order to realize the full potential of these roles, conference participants suggested that four key challenges must be addressed: access, capacity, commonality, and the scholar-practitioner link.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>The emergence of social media enables people to interact with others on the web in ways that are media-rich ("updates" or "posts" can be text, photo, audio, video, etc), time-shifted (correspondence need not happen at once or within a pre-defined time frame), and social in nature. By utilizing social media, citizen science projects can potentially engage many participants to contribute their observations covering a large geographic region and over a long time period. This is an improvement, for example, over traditional biodiversity surveys which typically involve relatively few people in confined regions and periods.As social media is not designed for scientific data collection and analysis, there is a problem in transferring unstructured information items (e.g. free-form text, unidentified images, etc.) often found in social media to structured data records for scientific tasks. To help bridge this gap, we propose an approach comprised of three steps: (1) Information Extraction, (2) Information Formalization, and (3) Information Reuse. We apply this approach to processing posts and comments from two Facebook interest groups on species observations. Our study demonstrates that with principled methods and proper tools, crowdsourced social media contents such as those from Facebook interest groups can be used for collaborative species identification and occurrence.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Falling prices have led to an ongoing spread of public displays in urban areas. Still, they mostly show passive content such as commercials and digital signage. At the same time, technological advances have enabled the creation of interactive displays potentially increasing their attractiveness for the audience, e.g. through providing a platform for civic discourse. This poses considerable challenges, since displays need to communicate the opportunity to engage, motivate the audience to do so, and be easy to use. In this paper we present Vote With Your Feet, a hyperlocal public polling tool for urban screens allowing users to express their opinions. Similar to vox populi interviews on TV or polls on news websites, the tool is meant to reflect the mindset of the community on topics such as current affairs, cultural identity and local matters. It is novel in that it focuses on a situated civic discourse and provides a tangible user interface, tackling the mentioned challenges. It shows one Yes/No question at a time and enables users to vote by stepping on one of two tangible buttons on the ground. This user interface was introduced to attract people's attention and to lower participation barriers. Our field study showed that Vote With Your Feet is perceived as inviting and that it can spark discussions among co-located people.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Effective intercultural collaboration requires intercultural competence. Intercultural competence involves awareness of the differences between cultures, knowledge about the beliefs, values, and practices of other cultures, and the skill to apply that knowledge effortlessly and effectively in interpersonal interactions. Acquiring intercultural competence can involve intensive study of the target culture, as well as immersion in social milieu of the target culture. Anyone who interacts regularly with people of other cultures can benefit from intercultural competence, but not everyone has the time and motivation to engage in lengthy cultural study, or the opportunity to immerse oneself in the other culture for extended periods.The focus of this talk is on the role of learning technologies in promoting intercultural competence. We address the problem of intercultural competence by means of computer-based serious games designed to help learners quickly acquire job-related linguistic and cultural proficiency. Videogame technology is used to create virtual worlds populated by non-player characters that speak and understand the target language, and behave in accordance with the norms of the culture. Conversational artificial intelligence technology enables learners to engage in spoken conversations with the non-player characters. Learners must speak the target language, and behave in a culturally proficient manner, in order to succeed at the game. cultural knowledge and skills, and organize them into curricula that serve as the basis for the game-based courses. Curriculum design focuses on the situations that learners are likely to encounter when interacting with people from the target culture, and tasks that they are likely to want to perform. This context provides a Cultural Lens that focuses curriculum development on the locations, socio-political factors, perspectives, and cultural practices that are most relevant to those situations and tasks. This approach results in courses that enable people to quickly acquire the intercultural skills that are most relevant to their particular needs. In the process they gain enhanced cultural awareness, which can support learners and motivate them to broaden and deepen their knowledge of the target culture. Military personnel engaged in civil affairs and peacekeeping operations are making extensive use of Alelo courses prior to overseas deployments. They report that the linguistic and cultural competence that they gained from the courses had a significant impact on the effectiveness of their operations. For example, a US Marine unit recently reported that it completed a tour of duty in Iraq without a single combat casualty. It attributed its success to its enhanced ability to develop relationships and establish rapport with the local people. We are currently developing a variety of other courses aimed at linguistic and cultural competence. Encounters: Global Chinese is an integrated course in Chinese language and culture, being developed in collaboration with Yale University Press and Chinese International Publishing Group. Rez World, developed in collaboration with Thornton Media, is designed to promote language and culture restoration among Native American tribes. A Web-based course for Voice of America is intended to provide VOA listeners worldwide with an opportunity to develop spoken English communication skills and develop a better understanding of American culture.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Classes in social innovation, technology-for-development and design thinking have become increasingly popular in recent years. On the one hand, this might be seen as a good thing. After all, the world needs as many smart, engaged citizens as it can get, particularly when you consider the multitude of challenges we face as a planet. But does a career in social change really begin in the classroom, or out in the real world? How much social change is planned, and how much accidental? And which approach tends to lead to the most meaningful, lasting or impactful solutions? In his talk, Ken Banks will talk about the rise of innovation 'outside the system', and how this is beginning to challenge conventional thinking around social innovation and the source of technology-for-development projects and interventions.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Participatory sensing is an emerging field in which citizens are empowered by technologies to monitor their own environments. Harvesting and analysing data gathered in response to personal or local enquiries can be seen as an antidote to information provided by official sources. Democratising sensing means that ordinary people can learn about and understand the world around them better and can be a part of the decision-making in improving environments for all. In this paper, we review and describe participatory sensing and discuss this in relation to making a series of prototype tools and applications for mobile users--Located Lexicon, Where's Fenton? and Tall Buildings. In the first of these projects, Located Lexicon, we wanted to find out whether a lexicon of terms derived from user-generated content could enable the formation of Twitter like groups that allow users to engage in finding out more about their location. In the second project, Where's Fenton? we made a publicly available app that involves users in counting the abundance and logging the location of deer in a park. This project focused specifically on anonymity of the user in collecting data for a specific enquiry. In the last project, Tall Buildings, we experimented with using dimensions of altitude, distance and speed to encourage users to physically explore a city from its rooftops. In all of these projects, we experiment with the pedestrian as a human sensor and the methods and roles they may engage in to make new discoveries. The underlying premise for our work is that it is not possible to calibrate people to be identical, so experimenting with crowd-sourced data opens up thinking about the way we observe and learn about the physical environment.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>In the public sector (particularly in the UK in light of recent reforms i.e. the Local Government Act 2000, etc.) a greater degree of accountability and public involvement or intervention has become the norm in public infrastructure projects, partially under the rubric of "stakeholder engagement". This paper seeks to discuss public involvement in a law-enforcement technology (Isis), which operates on a covert basis in the detection and prevention of child abuse activities across a number of social networking facilities. Our contribution to the development of Isis is to perform an ethics centered consultation process with stakeholders who will contribute to the design and deployment of the end software package. To that end, we have sought to develop a "Modified Participatory Design" approach, utilizing the knowledge gained from the HCI community with regards to more traditional design projects and adapting this body of work to questions of ethics, privacy, corporate and civic responsibility, monitoring and awareness issues, etc. in an effort to create a fluid and agile communication process between stakeholders and designers, thus taking account of the ethical issues around Isis as design occurs.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>This paper presents an empirical investigation of how people appropriated Twitter for socio-political talk in response to a television (TV) portrayal of people supported by state welfare and benefits. Our findings reveal how online discussion during, and in-between, TV broadcasts was characterised by distinctly different qualities, topics and user behaviours. These findings offer design opportunities for social media services to (i) support more balanced real-time commentaries of politically-charged media, (ii) actively promote discussion to continue after, and between, programming; and (iii) incorporate different motivations and attitudes towards socio-political concerns, as well as different practices of communicating those concerns. We contribute to the developing HCI literature on how social media intersects with political and civic engagement and specifically highlight the ways in which Twitter interacts with other forms of media as a site of everyday socio-political talk and debate.

<br><h1>Computing for the Social Good and Cultivating Cultures for Ethical Computing</h1>

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Why develop educational practices involving computing for the social good? Does the field of ethics provide a viable framework for assessing an evaluating such practices? And are projects that involve students in computing for the social good efficacious in the formation of ethical computing professionals? At Carnegie Mellon, we have developed practices to involve a significant number of students in software development projects and consulting engagements for the social good. A consulting course has had over 500 community service-learning engagements in 18 years, and in a software development capstone course our yearly cohort of 60 students work in small teams to develop software for 15+ social service organizations. Our practices have evolved out of our shared vision of what makes a good computing professional, but we would now like to better define, assess, and communicate what the vision is.The NSF has a program solicitation (15-528) entitled Cultivating Cultures for Ethical STEM (CCE STEM) that "funds research projects that identify factors that are efficacious in the formation of ethical STEM researchers in all the fields of science and engineering that NSF supports." It asks: "What constitutes ethical STEM research and practice? Which cultural and institutional contexts promote ethical STEM research and practice and why?" Among the factors they mention are "curricula ... that stress social responsibility and humanitarian goals"; i.e. computing for the social good. And "what practices contribute to the establishment and maintenance of ethical cultures and how can these practices be transferred, extended to, and integrated into other research and learning settings?"To provide some context from my experience, there are two prevalent types of computing-for-the-social-good projects:1. System-based: Projects that address a social-good (e.g. disaster management, public accountability, or medical record management) and are generally released to the public as open source projects (e.g. Sahana, Ushahidi, or OpenMRS).2. Client-based: Projects that custom-build a solution for a nonprofit, school, international NGO, or other social-good organization. For example, helping a nonprofit increase fundraising with a website, or a school improve interaction with its students using a course management system. Often, but not always, these solutions use the open source projects in (1), but in all cases the solution involves much more work than fetching the software.Our consulting and capstone project course use the client-based model. When done well, client-based social-good projects have the potential to enrich student learning in ambiguous real world environments. Students report increased confidence, further development of technical skills, a sense of satisfaction and appreciation for the needs of their partner organizations.Delivery of a tangible benefit to partner organizations is also generally an expected outcome. Providing lasting value to community partners should, in practice, be a key objective of any serious client engagement. However too often, the needs, concerns and ultimate outcomes for community partners are often overlooked or forgotten. Solutions that are incomplete, poorly implemented, poorly documented, inappropriate to the problem at hand or simply unsustainable may provide little or no value to community partners. In fact, these solutions may actually be detrimental to partner organizations.There is significant risk, therefore, that benefits to ICT service learning projects are asymmetric; students generally report significant benefits from the experience, but community based partners may, in fact, find the experience expensive, risky, and potentially harmful to their missions, organizations and employees. Many community partners simply do not have the resources to finish incomplete projects, sustain or maintain complex software or systems, or perform needed application or server administration.We use a capacity-building model of working with a community partner. This is not the let-us-buildyou-a-system model, where students develop and drop in (often unsustainable) technology solutions. Rather, it emphasizes working-with, and weaving solutions into the development partner's organization, building their capacity to not only use, but to maintain and evolve their solutions as their needs grow and change.Returning to the bigger question of cultivating a culture of ethical practice, these classes are meant to model an ethic of care in meeting the needs of a nonprofit client whose mission is the social good.They expose students to issues of:- Being truthful in working with the client: not misrepresenting their capabilities nor the robustness of their solution.- Being respectful and not misusing the client's time and other resources.- Not taking advantage of their team mates via slacking and free-loading.- Safeguarding the privacy and confidentiality of citizen information in any system they build, and including controls that maintain appropriate privacy and confidentiality.- Not misappropriating software, being aware of licenses, and attributing borrowed work that is otherwise not licensed.- Understanding the role of nonprofit organizations in society. How they are similar and different from for-profit corporations. How they contribute to the social good where markets would not otherwise serve.The NSF solicitation provides an opportunity to support looking at both why we do computing for the social good, and whether these educational practices develop computing professionals who are more aware of the ethical dimensions of their work. The solicitation encourages a comparison across institutions; is SIGCAS a good nexus for building that collaboration?As part of the SIGCAS Symposium, the author shared practices in the consulting and software development capstone courses, and the nascent evaluation ideas they are piloting. A goal is to get others' feedback and explore possibilities for collaboration.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>At the peak of the West African Ebola outbreak in December 2014, the only prospect for containing the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) was through behavior change to reduce transmission pathways. However, deeply ingrained beliefs, social systems, and cultural practices, combined with a lack of knowledge of the disease, made containment difficult. IBM Research - Africa, in collaboration with Sierra Leone Open Government Initiative (OGI), set up a call and SMS hotline to engage with citizens and understand issues on the ground using free text responses, which started on 19th Sept 2014 (during the first national lockdown). Localized versions of Centre for Disease Control (CDC) public health messages were broadcast on public radio along with a short question on Ebola, and listeners were encouraged to call or SMS the OGI hotline in reply to the question, or to report the current situation in their locality. Messages were categorized using a basic keyword search approach, based on categories that were determined manually, and the results of the analysis were communicated to the government via OGI. The initial deployment showed the potential of using a 2-way communication platform utilizing natural language responses to provide valuable feedback on behaviors and attitudes during a health emergency. Our presentation will describe the original platform, the outcomes of the analysis performed to date and the current work being undertaken to extend and scale the platform in Sierra Leone.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>The Science Literacy through Science Journalism (SciJourn) project aims to reframe the discussion of science literacy for citizenship, and explore how science journalism practices can be used to inform a cognitive apprenticeship that increases the science literacy of participants. This symposium features four paper presentations that report on the progress of the SciJourn project. We report on the development of standards for science content literacy based on the expertise exhibited by science journalists, assessment measures for science literacy, and assessment measures for engagement with science and technology. Finally, we describe our efforts aimed at apprenticing high-school aged learners into a science journalism community of practice spanning multiple schools and a community-based organization.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>We have designed a mobile application that takes advantage of the built-in features of smart phones such as camera and GPS that allow users to take geo-tagged photos while on the move. Urban residents can take pictures of broken street furniture and public property requiring repair, attach a brief description, and submit the information as a maintenance request to the local government organisation of their city. This paper discusses the design approach that led to the application, highlights a built-in mechanism to elicit user feedback, and evaluates the progress to date with user feedback and log statistics. It concludes with an outlook highlighting user requested features and our own design aspirations for moving from a reporting tool to a civic engagement tool.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>This paper describes the ongoing collaboration between the Department of Information Engineering of the University of Brescia and a local government agency. The goal is to create the socio-technical conditions for transferring the ability to develop web-based government-to-citizen services from software professionals to administrative personnel. To this end, proper end-user development techniques should be defined by capturing and exploiting employees' best practices and expertise. With reference to a typical government service, the paper reports summary results from a study of administrative personnel work practices and explores employees' motivations to become end-user software developers. It then outlines the design pattern language we have been defining for the considered domain to represent, from the employees' point of view, the problems encountered while creating government services together with their possible solutions. This is the starting point for identifying a further language that addresses the problem of end-user development of e-government services from an interaction-design point of view. These pattern languages can be regarded as metadesign tools for end-user development whose final aim is to support, and even improve, existing best practices in service creation, thus increasing employees' motivation and engagement in end-user development activities.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Open data is expected to enhance transparency, accountability and collaboration with citizens for government. Governments at all levels across all continents are therefore taking Initiatives to release their data in open domain. Open government data initiatives generally begin with a directive or a policy followed by a setting up of a data portal. All government agencies under the jurisdiction are then advised to contribute datasets in open format on the data portal. These contributing agencies face a lot of challenge right from understanding open data, capacity to compile good quality data, technology integration, potential apps, availability of funds and allocation of duty to institutional support. There is a need to enable and equip these government agencies with necessary skillsets to contribute high quality datasets. Departments also need to be equipped with necessary technology & administrative support to engage with Citizens willing to use data in open domain. Effective collaboration with community is also necessary to achieve potential use of datasets released. Further provisions should also be made in policy to achieve its institutionalization in the departments to achieve sustained release of high quality, high value datasets over a long time.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>In the last thirty years the role of the government has moved consistently away from services provision to regulation. Society and economy has become more interconnected, unstable and unpredictable than ever, and citizens are keener to engage in complex policy making. Within this context, traditional tools for policy making, based upon the perfectly rational representative agent maximizing its own utility in a general equilibrium framework, have been demonstrated to be unable to predict and cope with some of today's most pressing challenges, such as the financial crisis and climate change. Despite the explosion of data availability, the possibility to analyse them through crowdsourcing and large scale collaboration, the advance in modelling and simulation tools for assessing non-linear impact of policy options, the full potential offered by the new instruments for policy making has yet to be achieved. Therefore policy makers have not yet at their disposal a set of instruments able to cope with the needs stemming from their decision making activities.In order to meet those needs the project CROSSOVER "Bridging Communities for Next Generation Policy-Making" is elaborating a demand/driven "International Research Roadmap on ICT tools for Governance and Policy Modelling", which links the needs and the activities of policy-making with current and future research challenges.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Recent developments in digitally mediated games such as the Nintendo Wii aim to encourage exercise. This paper focuses on assessing the efficacy of the Nintendo Wii, popular in the United States and Japan, in promoting regular exercise among senior citizens in Singapore (aged 65 years and above). Adapting from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), this exploratory study examines senior citizens' perceptions of the Nintendo Wii. Twenty-eight participants took part in this pilot study conducted at a senior citizens centre in Singapore. Data collection was carried out via a self-reported questionnaire and video observation. Findings indicate that senior citizens perceived the Nitindo Wii usable with realistic depictions of games and had positive engagement with the Wii games. However, contrary to prior belief, findings did not show that perceived usefulness has a significant influence on senior citizens' intention to use the Wii for improving social interaction, health and exercise. The paper concludes with a discussion on the design and impact of digitally mediated games for elderly users.

<br><b>Abstract: </b>Due to recent technical developments, urban systems generate large and complex data sets. While visualizations have been used to make these accessible, often they are tailored to one specific group of users, typically the public or expert users. We present Touching Transport, an application that allows a diverse group of users to visually explore public transit data on a multi-touch tabletop. It provides multiple perspectives of the data and consists of three visualization modes conveying tempo-spatial patterns as map, time-series, and arc view. We exhibited our system publicly, and evaluated it in a lab study with three distinct user groups: citizens with knowledge of the local environment, experts in the domain of public transport, and non-experts with neither local nor domain knowledge. Our observations and evaluation results show we achieved our goals of both attracting visitors to explore the data while enabling gathering insights for both citizens and experts. We discuss the design considerations in developing our system, and describe our lessons learned in designing engaging tabletop visualizations.
