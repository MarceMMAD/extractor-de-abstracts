Content is not part of some supply chain, where you create, publish, and archive. Content has a lifecycle that is complex and often iterative. Web publishing, in particular, has unique needs. Publishing now requires a level of planning that addresses the technical and business requirements, and the editorial, social, and process aspects of publishing in a holistic way. Content strategy is a comprehensive plan that builds a framework to create, manage, deliver, share, and archive or renew content in reliable ways. Content strategy is an emerging discipline, already making its mark with improved returns on investment and internal efficiencies in the way governments provide information, support transactions, and foster citizen engagement.

It sets an exploratory path towards a chorographic metrics able to convey the social meaning of territory. I analyze the profound changes that have occurred in contemporary cartographic production, especially those investing the role of the interpreter and those related to the unprecedented social needs that maps are called upon to address. First I will consider the outcomes that Information Technology (IT) has had on mapping in promoting a wide range of new production sites and new professional profiles for cartographers. Then I will survey the social landscape that shows cartography’s involvement in the practices of democratization, both within governance policies or territorial planning and in terms of citizen access to data from public institutions. Finally, I will discuss the issue of participation in the collection of cartographic data and propose a model, pioneered in the field of environmental protection in Africa. I will present a methodology, called \{SIGAP\} (Geographic Information Systems for Protected Areas), which takes charge of the entire process of cartographic construction and produces participatory tools based on the use of geographic information systems (GIS). That will lead us to reflect on the semantic consequences of the availability of \{GIS\} tools online and, more specifically, to consider interactivity as a participatory potential for web-based cartography. This chapter will therefore provide a reflection on the importance of method for retrieving cartographic data; on the vital role of participation in the construction of maps; and on the potential WebGIS offer to promote such participation. These are essential conditions for rendering landscape in modes that pave the way to a chorography.∗<br><h1>Chapter 16 - Civic Engagement and Aging</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Stephen J.

We examine conceptual, theoretical, and measurement issues in the study of civic engagement; review findings on trends and life course variation; discuss implications of civic engagement for older adults and for society; and consider directions for further research. Publisher Summary Interest in the civic engagement of older Americans has increased considerably among social scientists, policymakers, and governmental and nonprofit leaders for several reasons. Dramatic gains in health, education, and longevity over the past half century have increased individuals' capacity for civic roles and contributions in later life. Prompted by research linking civic engagement with healthy, successful aging, policymakers and government officials are interested in promoting service opportunities for older Americans that can benefit society as well as the volunteers themselves. Finally, facing an escalating demand for social services and concerns about the loss of traditional volunteers—especially housewives—nonprofit sector leaders have stepped up efforts to enlist the growing population of older persons to help fill the gap. This chapter examines civic engagement from the perspectives of conceptual and theoretical issues and measurement issues. It provides an overview of findings on trends and life course variation in civic engagement; and discusses implications of civic engagement for older adults and for society, respectively. Evidence to date indicates that civic engagement benefits both participants and the broader community. Recent research has sought to identify civic engagement as a formal retirement role, distinguished in terms of level of commitment that goes beyond the act of volunteering itself.<br><h1>Chapter 39 - How Can Nanotechnologies Fulfill the Needs of Developing Countries?</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>David J.

This chapter discusses those engagements, with a particular focus on the findings of a “nanodialogue” held in Zimbabwe during July 2006 involving scientists and representatives of two communities that experience real problems with the supply of clean drinking water. Concerns of society often focus on risk and this has been found to be especially true when public engagement is delayed. Upstream engagement appears to encourage the public to focus on imagining positive outcomes for nanotechnologies. We raise issues in relation to the purpose of new science, such as nanotechnology. The chapter puts forward a model where human need rather than just consumer wants might influence the development of nanotechnologies. The chapter ends with some speculation about future directions that are desirable if the social and ethical concerns of society are to be met. The dialogues held in Zimbabwe are one small step towards this new direction. They connect the needs of poor people with scientists who are in the process of developing new applications of nanotechnologies. The next step will be to move beyond dialogue towards the engagement of the scientist with relevant stakeholders in developing countries.<br><h1>Chapter 8 - People and Problems in the Courts</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Lawrence F.

Defense counsel can be paid for by the defendant or provided through public defenders and assigned counsel. In a pro se defense the defendant represents him- or herself. The prosecutor is elected and represents the state. Several methods exist to select judges, including partisan and nonpartisan election, and appointment. The Missouri Plan combines appointment and elective processes. Juries are panels of citizens authorized to make judicial decisions; they are selected in voir dire by defense counsel and prosecutors. Grand juries review evidence and determine formal charges. Petit juries are trial juries. The issues of speedy trial, the courtroom work group, free press/fair trial, community courts, plea bargaining, citizen/victim participation, and the impact of technology are important. A recent trend is problem-oriented courts, ranging from courts focused on specific offenses/offenders, such as drug courts, to courts designed to address broad problems of the community.

Students in human-computer interaction courses learn early (and often) about how important it is to understand one's users. “User-centered design” is a well-known process involving the participation of representatives of the target user group at all stages of the design process. Design innovation can be supported by thinking through categories of activity or need. Shneiderman's activity-relationship framework is a tool to generate possible technologies to support people as they act in various relationship roles, such as a member of a family or a citizen. Three broad classes of activity spaces that are outside formal learning contexts include play; interests and hobbies; and communication, self-expression, and identity. The chapter discusses some of the emerging interaction techniques that could play interesting roles in future children's mobile technologies each activity type and highlight aspects that might inspire design proposals.<br><h1>Adolescent Moral Development</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>A.

Okediji<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080970868861577">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080970868861577</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>Abstract The conclusion of the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) in 1994 established a minimum baseline for regulating access to technology and knowledge goods. This global regime of intellectual property rights has since been a contentious aspect of modern economic relations. It has been viewed by consumers around the world as a significant barrier to access to technology and associated knowledge goods, including stymieing opportunities for social and political engagement by citizens. Public disenchantment with intellectual property as a primary regulator of access to technology could be addressed by the explicit linkage of proprietary rights to a new welfare axis comprised of development aspirations, human rights norms, and liberty considerations. To the extent social norms that develop around new technologies facilitate positive returns recognized by these complementary legal regimes, intellectual property rights that are in tension with these regimes will likely continue to lose moral sway, making the future of the \{TRIPS\} Agreement far less stable and its minimum obligations more costly to enforce. Moreover, gaps in how formal law and social norms regulate technology are not easily captured by the rigid prescriptions of treaty provisions, and thus the \{TRIPS\} Agreement is far less capable of serving the important role of shaping contemporary approaches to access to technology. As technology continues to reach deep into the private lives of citizens, and to affect the capacity and trajectory of national development in less-advanced economies, the design and construction of formal laws around which technology is produced, disseminated, and used will have greater import if they purposefully accommodate other legal orders whose norms resonate powerfully in advancing stylized visions of societal progress and human well-being.<br><h1>1 - Web 2.0 and social media</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Alan Oxley<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781843347149500012">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781843347149500012</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>Abstract: Some background material sets the scene. Technological evolution is not a new phenomenon. For example, dramatic changes in work practices must have resulted from the introduction of the telephone. Public service employees began making extensive use of the internet and the web in about 2000. One key development, dating from about 2009, is the desire by senior politicians for the public to become more involved with government through online interaction. Taken to its extreme, theoretically, all major decisions could be made by citizens effectively instantaneously, by online voting. The information technology that is the subject of this book is Web 2.0, which concerns the ability to share information on the web, for users, especially the general public, to collaborate. The significance of Web 2.0 is outlined, and the participation–collaboration pattern, the declarative living pattern and the tag gardening pattern are explained. Social media and social networking are briefly summarized.<br><h1>Community in the information age: Exploring the social potential of web-based technologies in landscape architecture and community design </h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Deni Ruggeria, Deven Youngb, , , <br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095263515000709

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractCritics have pointed at new technologies as culprits in the decline of civic life, neighboring and social capital construction in Western societies. When applied to community design and planning processes, technologies can empower residents to actively engage in decision-making, foster connections across social groups, with positive consequences on life and socialization in public spaces. What kind of participation do technologies foster? And is it the kind that bridges social and ideological divides?The 2012 community design process for Hawthorne Park in Medford, Oregon illustrates many of the challenges and opportunities connected to the use of new technologies in design. In the process, technologies were instrumental in enlisting a larger-than-usual number of residents to participate in the design of the park. Blogs and online questionnaires were successful in gathering people×³s thoughts on the design choices being made, but also favored a limited, intermittent form of engagement. The results are synthesized in principles for the successful integration of web-based technologies in future community design efforts: adaptability, full participation, nuanced participation and the need for links to the physical realm.<br><h1>Can blogs function as rhetorical publics in Asian democracies?

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractSocial media platforms such as blogs have been said to improve and expand the potential of the Internet in enabling open access to political discourse. Yet several factors may undermine such potential, even in a place like Singapore, where Internet penetration and usage of social media are high. Participation remains fragmented, with certain groups more active than others, raising questions on the viability of the Internet as a public sphere. The context and conditions under which online publics function provide important basis for understanding the use of social media, yet this has often been overlooked. We examine the use of blogs in Singapore as sites for discursive exchanges, civic engagement, and community construction, and discuss the sustainability of blogs as multiple publics in a functioning Asian democracy.<br><h1>Interactive, Asynchronous, Face-to-Face: Does it Really Make a Difference? â</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Caroline Akhras, , Chukri Akhras<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042813011336

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractWith the advent of WEB 2.0, the internet has become participatory and interactive. As a practitioner-researchers, we perceive that business students are citizens of this digital world and are continuously searching for the right tools for the teaching/learning environment. Web 2.0 characteristics support the principles of good teaching and learning– active participation and collaboration. This case study illustrates three different learning environments: face-to-face, virtual learning classrooms, online interactive blogs. A sample was drawn from three different undergraduate business courses. The results show that integrating WEB 2.0 interactive tools seems to be the best.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractBetween Twitter revolutions and Facebook elections, there is a growing belief that information and communication technologies are changing the way democracy is practiced. The discourse around e-government and online deliberation is frequently focused on technical solutions and based in the belief that if you build it correctly they will come. This paper departs from the literature on digital divide to examine barriers to online civic participation in policy deliberation. While most scholarship focuses on identifying and describing those barriers, this study offers an in-depth analysis of what it takes to address them using a particular case study. Based in the tradition of action research, this paper focuses on analysis of practices that evolved in Regulation Room—a research project of CeRI (Cornell eRulemaking Initiative) that works with federal government agencies in helping them engage public in complex policymaking processes. It draws a multidimensional picture of motivation, skill, and general political participation divides; or the “analog” aspects of the digital divide in online civic participation and policy deliberation.<br><h1>Modelling with stakeholders – Next generation </h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Alexey Voinova, , Nagesh Kolaganib, , , Michael K.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThis paper updates and builds on ‘Modelling with Stakeholders’ Voinov and Bousquet, 2010 which demonstrated the importance of, and demand for, stakeholder participation in resource and environmental modelling. This position paper returns to the concepts of that publication and reviews the progress made since 2010. A new development is the wide introduction and acceptance of social media and web applications, which dramatically changes the context and scale of stakeholder interactions and participation. Technology advances make it easier to incorporate information in interactive formats via visualization and games to augment participatory experiences. Citizens as stakeholders are increasingly demanding to be engaged in planning decisions that affect them and their communities, at scales from local to global. How people interact with and access models and data is rapidly evolving. In turn, this requires changes in how models are built, packaged, and disseminated: citizens are less in awe of experts and external authorities, and they are increasingly aware of their own capabilities to provide inputs to planning processes, including models. The continued acceleration of environmental degradation and natural resource depletion accompanies these societal changes, even as there is a growing acceptance of the need to transition to alternative, possibly very different, life styles. Substantive transitions cannot occur without significant changes in human behaviour and perceptions. The important and diverse roles that models can play in guiding human behaviour, and in disseminating and increasing societal knowledge, are a feature of stakeholder processes today.<br><h1>Facebook: The enabler of online civic engagement for activists</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Anne Marie Warrena, , , Ainin Sulaimana, , Noor Ismawati Jaafarb, <br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563213004664

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThis exploratory study aims to investigate the existing efforts in civic engagement using Facebook. Previous work describes the typical usage of Facebook for connecting with others, to educate and inform in a wide range of context. Little research exists, however, on the emerging role of Facebook as an enabler for civic engagement in a social network environment. With over one billion global Facebook users, there is emerging evidence that activists are making concerted efforts to utilize Facebook’s dynamic ability for addressing social issues. The present study conducted face-to-face interviews with twelve activists in examining how Facebook was used to conduct civic engagement activities that address social issues. The analysis was based on the five criteria of Internet activism, i.e. collection of information; publication of information; dialogue; coordinating actions and lobbying for decision makers. The results revealed that activists are using Facebook to seek information, check on others, follow links, post civic messages, promote social events, appeal for donations, call for volunteers, discuss social issues, schedule plans and advocate change. These findings indicate that activists are using Facebook to shape the traditional civic engagement landscape in an online realm. Future opportunities for this stream of research are then discussed before concluding.<br><h1>Effective dialogue: Enhanced public engagement as a legitimising tool for municipal waste management decision-making</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Kenisha Garnetta, , , Tim Cooperb, <br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X14003663

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThe complexity of municipal waste management decision-making has increased in recent years, accompanied by growing scrutiny from stakeholders, including local communities. This complexity reflects a socio-technical framing of the risks and social impacts associated with selecting technologies and sites for waste treatment and disposal facilities. Consequently there is growing pressure on local authorities for stakeholders (including communities) to be given an early opportunity to shape local waste policy in order to encourage swift planning, development and acceptance of the technologies needed to meet statutory targets to divert waste from landfill. This paper presents findings from a research project that explored the use of analytical–deliberative processes as a legitimising tool for waste management decision-making. Adopting a mixed methods approach, the study revealed that communicating the practical benefits of more inclusive forms of engagement is proving difficult even though planning and policy delays are hindering development and implementation of waste management infrastructure. Adopting analytical–deliberative processes at a more strategic level will require local authorities and practitioners to demonstrate how expert-citizen deliberations may foster progress in resolving controversial issues, through change in individuals, communities and institutions. The findings suggest that a significant shift in culture will be necessary for local authorities to realise the potential of more inclusive decision processes. This calls for political actors and civic society to collaborate in institutionalising public involvement in both strategic and local planning structures.<br><h1>Media multitasking during political news consumption: A relationship with factual and subjective political knowledge</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Weina Rana, , , Masahiro Yamamotob, , Shan Xuc, <br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215302764

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractGrowth of digital, social, and mobile media has enabled engagement with multiple media activities during news consumption in a more efficient and synchronous fashion than before. This study investigates whether media multitasking activities while consuming political news affects individuals' levels of subjective and factual political knowledge. Results from a Web survey of online panel members show that on the whole, pairwise and bundled forms of media multitasking are negatively related to factual political knowledge. Also, those who engage in media multitasking are more likely to report that they are politically knowledgeable but they do not know about politics as much as they think they do. Implications are discussed for media multitasking and an informed citizenry.<br><h1>Mining citizen emotions to estimate the urgency of urban issues</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Christian Masdevala, , , Adriano Velosob, <br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030643791500126X

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractCrowdsourcing technology offers exciting possibilities for local governments. Specifically, citizens are increasingly taking part in reporting and discussing issues related to their neighborhood and problems they encounter on a daily basis, such as overflowing trash-bins, broken footpaths and lifts, illegal graffiti, and potholes. Pervasive citizen participation enables local governments to respond more efficiently to these urban issues. This interaction between citizens and municipalities is largely promoted by civic engagement platforms, such as See-Click-Fix, FixMyStreet, CitySourced, and OpenIDEO, which allow citizens to report urban issues by entering free text describing what needs to be done, fixed or changed. In order to develop appropriate action plans and priorities, government officials need to figure out how urgent are the reported issues. In this paper we propose to estimate the urgency of urban issues by mining different emotions that are implicit in the text describing the issue. More specifically, a reported issue is first categorized according to the emotions expressed in it, and then the corresponding emotion scores are combined in order to produce a final urgency level for the reported issue. Our experiments use the SeeClickFix hackathon data and diverse emotion classification algorithms. They indicate that (i) emotions can be categorized efficiently with supervised learning algorithms, and (ii) the use of citizen emotions leads to accurate urgency estimates. Further, using additional features such as the type of issue or its author leads to no further accuracy gains.<br><h1>Individual and social benefits of online discussion forums</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Louise F.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThere has been much debate surrounding the potential benefits and costs of online interaction. The present research argues that engagement with online discussion forums can have underappreciated benefits for users’ well-being and engagement in offline civic action, and that identification with other online forum users plays a key role in this regard. Users of a variety of online discussion forums participated in this study. We hypothesized and found that participants who felt their expectations had been exceeded by the forum reported higher levels of forum identification. Identification, in turn, predicted their satisfaction with life and involvement in offline civic activities. Formal analyses confirmed that identification served as a mediator for both of these outcomes. Importantly, whether the forum concerned a stigmatized topic moderated certain of these relationships. Findings are discussed in the context of theoretical and applied implications.<br><h1>Online participation in climate change adaptation: A case study of agricultural adaptation measures in Northern Italy</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Dragana Bojovica, b, , , Laura Bonzanigoa, b, Carlo Giupponia, b, Alexandros Maziotisc<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479715300049

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThe new EU strategy on adaptation to climate change suggests flexible and participatory approaches. Face-to-face contact, although it involves time-consuming procedures with a limited audience, has often been considered the most effective participatory approach. In recent years, however, there has been an increase in the visibility of different citizens' initiatives in the online world, which strengthens the possibility of greater citizen agency. This paper investigates whether the Internet can ensure efficient public participation with meaningful engagement in climate change adaptation. In elucidating issues regarding climate change adaptation, we developed an eParticipation framework to explore adaptation capacity of agriculture to climate change in Northern Italy. Farmers were mobilised using a pre-existing online network. First they took part in an online questionnaire for revealing their perceptions of and reactions to the impacts of ongoing changes in agriculture. We used these results to suggest a portfolio of policy measures and to set evaluation criteria. Farmers then evaluated these policy options, using a multi criteria analysis tool with a simple user-friendly interface. Our results showed that eParticipation is efficient: it supports a rapid data collection, while involving high number of participants. Moreover, we demonstrated that the digital divide is decreasingly an obstacle for using online spaces for public engagement. This research does not present eParticipation as a panacea. Rather, eParticipation was implemented with well-established participatory approaches to both validate the results and, consequently, communicate meaningful messages on local agricultural adaptation practices to regional decision-makers. Feedbacks from the regional decision-makers showed their interest in using eParticipation to improve communication with farmers in the future. We expect that, with further Internet proliferation, eParticipation may allow the inclusion of more representative samples, which would contribute to an informed and legitimate decision-making process.<br><h1>Suggesting frameworks of citizen-sourcing via Government 2.0</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Taewoo Nam, Author Vitae<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X11001092

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThrough various platforms enabled by Web 2.0 technologies, citizens can collectively create public information, provide service, and take part in policy processes. Pushed by the Open Government Directive of the Obama administration, citizen-sourcing may be a new mode of government operations in the U.S. This paper suggests two frameworks to examine the emerging mechanism. The first framework provides three dimensions of citizen-sourcing initiatives: purpose (image-making or ideation), collective intelligence type (professional knowledge or innovative ideas), and strategy (contest, wiki, social networking, or social voting). Second, the paper presents a framework for assessing current citizen-sourcing initiatives. Its categories include design evaluation, process evaluation, and outcome evaluation. The performance of citizen-sourcing primarily depends on the appropriateness of the platform design. The effectiveness of the process needs to be evaluated in terms of the Open Government Directive's three pillar goals of transparency, participation, and collaboration. Evaluating the impact of citizen-sourcing will reveal whether citizen-sourcing is rhetorical or if it actually exerts significant effects on society.<br><h1>Public participation in GIS via mobile applications</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Maria Antonia Brovelli1, , Marco Minghini, , Giorgio Zamboni2, <br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092427161500101X

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractDriven by the recent trends in the GIS domain including Volunteered Geographic Information, geo-crowdsourcing and citizen science, and fostered by the constant technological advances, collection and dissemination of geospatial information by ordinary people has become commonplace. However, applications involving user-generated geospatial content show dramatically diversified patterns in terms of incentive, type and level of participation, purpose of the activity, data/metadata provided and data quality. This study contributes to this heterogeneous context by investigating public participation in GIS within the field of mobile-based applications. Results not only show examples of how to technically build GIS applications enabling user collection and interaction with geospatial data, but they also draw conclusions about the methods and needs of public participation. We describe three projects with different scales and purposes in the context of urban monitoring and planning, and tourism valorisation. In each case, an open source architecture is used, allowing users to exploit their mobile devices to collect georeferenced information. This data is then made publicly available on specific Web viewers. Analysis of user involvement in these projects provides insights related to participation patterns which suggests some generalized conclusions.<br><h1>Emergency management perspectives on volunteered geographic information: Opportunities, challenges and change</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Billy Haworth, <br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971516300175

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractVolunteered geographic information (VGI) refers to the widespread creation and sharing of geographic information by private citizens, often through platforms such as online mapping tools, social media, and smartphone applications. VGI has shifted the ways information is created, shared, used and experienced, with important implications for applications of geospatial data, including emergency management. Detailed interviews with 13 emergency management professionals from eight organisations across five Australian states provided insights into the impacts of VGI on official emergency management. Perceived opportunities presented by VGI included improved communication, acquisition of diverse local information, and increased community engagement in disaster management. Identified challenges included the digital divide, data management, misinformation, and liability concerns. Significantly, VGI disrupts the traditional top-down structure of emergency management and reflects a culture shift away from authoritative control of information. To capitalise on the opportunities of VGI, agencies need to share responsibility and be willing to remain flexible in supporting positive community practises, including VGI. Given the high accountability and inherently responsive nature of decision making in disaster management, it provides a useful lens through which to examine the impacts of VGI on official authoritative systems more broadly. This analysis of the perceptions of emergency management professionals suggests changes to traditional systems that involve decentralisation of power and increased empowerment of citizens, where value is increasingly recognised in both expert and citizen-produced information, initiatives and practises.<br><h1>Planning activism: Using Social Media to claim marginalized citizens’ right to the city</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Ali Tayebi, <br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264275113000371

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractFinding a physical solution for complex social problems has been one of the dominant approaches in planning experiences since the beginning of 20th century. Expansion of scientific rationality in social science is one of the theoretical foundations of these experiences that led to domination of comprehensive planning as rational and efficient way of doing planning in many cities. After Habermas introduces communicative rationality as an alternative for scientific rationality, many planners have tried to bring his idea in planning and define new roles for planners such as advocates, facilitators, and mediators. This paper does not aim to enter this discussion to define a formal role for planners in exiting planning structure, instead it introduces an informal role for planners as activists outside power structure and planning departments to pursue marginalized citizens’ right to the city. Planning activists, like other kind of activist such as Human Right activists, work with marginalized citizens to raise their voices in existing decision-making processes and power structures. Since Information Technology and Social Media have revolutionized activists’ works in pursuing their causes around the world, this paper discuss how planning activists can use these tools to advocate both parts of citizens’ right to the city, which are right of participation and right of appropriation.<br><h1>An empirical analysis of e-participation.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThe aim of this paper is to further explore the drivers behind the decision of citizens to engage in social and political participation on the internet, since mixed empirical evidence has been found in the literature. Using data from the 2011 survey on the use of information and communications technologies by households and individuals in Spain, the following two types of e-participation are analyzed: reading/giving opinions about social/political issues and signing/taking part in online petitions/public consultations. Relying on an updated version of the resources approach, we investigate as to what extent e-participation is explained not only by traditional participation-related resources (i.e., socio-economic characteristics) but also by digital skills, social networks and the online development of public administrations. Results show that, while online participation is mainly associated with internet-related skills, there is a significant gender gap. Interestingly, the unemployed tend to engage socially and politically online more than the rest of the population.<br><h1>Facebook and political engagement: A study of online political group membership and offline political engagement</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Meredith Conroya, , Jessica T.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractIn what ways do online groups help to foster political engagement among citizens? We employ a multi-method design incorporating content analysis of online political group pages and original survey research of university undergraduates (n = 455) to assess the relationship between online political group membership and political engagement—measured through political knowledge and political participation surrounding the 2008 election. We find that participation in online political groups is strongly correlated with offline political participation, as a potential function of engaging members online. However, we fail to confirm that there is a corresponding positive relationship between participation in online political groups and political knowledge, likely due to low quality online group discussion.<br><h1>Applying the technology acceptance model to a Spanish City Hall â</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>José Luis Moreno Cegarraa, Author Vitae, Juan Gabriel Cegarra Navarroa, 1, , Author Vitae, José Rodrigo Córdoba Pachónb, Author Vitae<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401214000176

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThis paper examines the relative importance and significance of the four technology enablers introduced by Davis (1989) in the technology acceptance model (TAM) (perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude towards using and behavioural intention) for use on four different levels of citizen engagement in e-government (null, publish, interact and transact). An extended technology acceptance model (TAM) is developed to test citizen engagement towards online e-government services from a sample of 307 citizens who used the benefits advisor tool within a Spanish City Hall. Although the proposed model follows TAM and explains the intention towards the actual use of e-government by postulating four direct determinants, “A, PU, PEOU and BI” have been considered as parallel processes, meaning that each can have separate influence in different levels of citizen engagement. To achieve this goal, a multinomial logistic regression is developed and tested to confirm the explanatory power of the four technology enablers on the four different levels of e-government. Our findings further suggest that in order to implement e-government, some of the enablers matter more than others to move from one level of citizen engagement to another. The main contribution of the paper is to question the use of existing models which seek to represent the relationship between technology enablers and the adoption of e-government services without considering their impacts on citizens’ engagement. The implications of the findings are discussed and useful insights are provided in relation to policy recommendations geared to create appropriate conditions to build citizens’ engagement intent of use of e-government services.<br><h1>Proposing an open-source model for unconventional participation to energy planning</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Fabrizio Fattori, , Davide Albini, Norma Anglani <br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629616300160

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractIn this paper we present MELiSsa, a local multi-regional energy system model of a specific area: the Lombardy region. MELiSsa, implemented through an open-code modeling framework (OSeMOSYS), is built upon transparent relations and open data. Building this model is a first step towards four main goals: (i) extending the energy planning process of the region to citizens and experts usually not involved; (ii) exploiting this uncommon participation for a crowd-source development; (iii) providing a simple tool for interested local citizens to get consciousness of the technological and behavioral limits of their energy system; (iv) providing a real-case-based platform for interdisciplinary research and academic purposes possibly beyond the region boundaries. The current structure and input data of MELiSsa are presented and discussed together with a demonstrative analysis. Preliminary results show that interdisciplinary participation is enabled as an opportunity and it is needed to properly model technological dynamics as well as non-technological issues that will be relevant within the path to reach environmental, economic and social targets.<br><h1>Cross-cultural values and management preferences in protected areas of Norway and Poland</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Greg Browna, , , Vera Helene Hausnerb, , MaÅgorzata GrodziÅska-Jurczakc, , Agata Pietrzyk-KaszyÅskad, , Agnieszka OlszaÅskad, , Barbara Peekd, , Marcin RechciÅskie, , Eiliv Lægreidb, <br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1617138115300194

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractProtected areas provide important ecosystem services globally but few studies have examined how cultural differences influence the distribution of cultural ecosystem values and management preferences. We used internet-based public participation GIS (PPGIS) in the countries of Norway and Poland to identify ecosystem values and management preferences in protected areas held by regional residents and site users. We found significant differences in the type and quantity of ecosystem values with Norwegians mapping more values relating to use of resources (e.g., hunting/fishing, gathering) and Polish respondents mapping more environmental values such as scenery, biological diversity, and water quality. With respect to management preferences, Norwegians identified more preferences for resource utilization while Polish respondents identified more preferences for conservation. Norwegian respondents were more satisfied with protected area management and local participation which can be explained by historical, legal, and cultural differences between the two countries. For Norway, biodiversity conservation in protected areas will continue to be guided by sustainable use of protected areas, rather than strict nature protection, with management favoring local board control and active public participation. For Poland, change in protected area management to enhance biodiversity conservation is less certain, driven by national environmental values that conflict with local values and preferences, continuing distrust in government, and low levels of civic participation. Differential efficacy in PPGIS methods – Norway with greater participation from household sampling and Poland with greater response using social media – suggest different strategies will be required for effective public engagement in protected area planning and management.<br><h1>Open government objectives and participation motivations</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Fons WijnhovenaAuthor Vitae, Michel EhrenhardaAuthor Vitae, Johannes KuhnbAuthor Vitae<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X14001555

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractOpen government aims, among others, at improving engagement of citizens in public sector activities. To realize this potential, we need to understand citizens' motivations to engage in the many different variants of open government. This article identifies motivations for open government participation from the free/libre open source software (FLOSS) and crowdsourcing literature. The literature gives two dimensions of open government aims: innovation objectives (high or low) and managerial level (political versus administrative). The results of our survey with 168 participants revealed different motivations for participation in open government projects related to three objectives of open government projects: collaborative democracy, citizen sourcing, and citizen ideation & innovation. We found indications that socio-economic characteristics of citizens do not influence the willingness to participate in open government projects—contrary to findings in other forms of government participation—and therefore open government opens a great potential for enlarged citizen engagement. Our survey also indicates that open government projects with lower ambitions result in more participation than more ambitious projects, which implies that considerable steps need to be taken to realize the full potential of open government.<br><h1>The 2014 CLSR-LSPI Lisbon seminar on ‘the digital citizen’ – Presented at the 9th International Conference on Legal, Security and Privacy Issues in IT Law (LSPI) 15–17 October 2014, Vieira De Almeida & Associados, Lisbon, Portugal</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Steve Saxby  (Seminar Chair: Professor, Editor-in-Chief)<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0267364915000345

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>Abstract‘The Digital Citizen’ has become a buzzword in recent years as part of the social and economic agendas of many countries and as a key theme in the strategy for Europe 2020. In 2014, the Vice-President of the European Commission and Commissioner for the Digital Agenda, Neelie Kroes, described its emergence as “people with greater access to information, people empowered to shape the world around them. More able to both learn: and participate”.1 Yet, while the benefits of this vision are clear, harnessing the opportunities on offer requires confronting significant challenges.In seeking to explore what this empowering concept means for law and policy-makers today, this Seminar is intended to encourage reflection upon how increasing digitisation and hyper-connectivity affects our day-to-day interactions with those in power, as well as the security and privacy issues arising from them. For example, in many countries the development of new forms of digital identity management enables citizens to assert their identity electronically in order to access public services (such as online access to their medical data). However, these can only work optimally when supported by citizen-centric policy and legal frameworks that are technology-neutral, trust enhancing and mutually recognised across borders.New data-driven and virtual relationships with governments also necessitate a reconsideration of the rights that digital citizen deserve. On the one hand, the ease with which increasing amounts of accessible personal data can be collected – overtly or covertly – and analysed by states about their citizens' raises concerns about lost privacy controls and substantial power imbalances (such as regarding storage and access rights to such data). On the other hand, massive improvements in accessing information permit opportunities for greater engagement with government by individuals, yet assume the rollout of better and faster internet connectivity for all citizens to participate. In turn, social media has demonstrated how ICT can facilitate collective citizen activism to pressure for societal change, alongside the power of sousveillance to act as a countervailing force to pervasive state monitoring.Also ripe for discussion is the notion of reciprocal responsibilities between citizens and governments. In the physical space, for example, concerns are mounting over the implications of the advent of cheap wearable computers and drones. In the virtual domain, the borderless nature of the online world and its distributed control has connotations for a wider concept of networked citizenship with attendant rights. This led the creator of the Web – Sir Tim Berners-Lee – to call for a Bill of Rights (a ‘Magna Carta for the Web’) in 2014, the Web's 25th birthday, to protect its users. Citizen rights that already exist relevant to the online environment are scattered across various laws and are not always easy to understand. The roles of transnational institutions in fostering closer international cooperation on ICT policy, as well as strengthening confidence in privacy, consumer and data protection rights online, are also topics for discussion in this respect.Questions for discussion include: What does digital citizenship mean today? What rights, obligations and responsibilities should be associated with digital citizenship? What types of legal solutions are fit for purpose to protect digital citizenship interests? What should be the role of public sectors in e-identity assurance schemes, such as regarding liability? Should e-identity management be regulated? How does digital citizenship relate to novel rights, such as a right to public-sector data and a right to be forgotten online, and how might these rights be enforced effectively? To what extent can law and policy support increase transparency and trust by citizens in the actions of their governments? How can privacy and security be guaranteed to citizens where automated technologies affect their rights and civil liberties? How are biometrics and location-tracking devices used by states in body surveillance changing the digital citizenship landscape? How can individuals be more empowered to control their personal data held by governments and give informed consent to its use? What are the global drivers of digital citizenship policies and international cooperation in rule making and standard setting, especially in relation to emerging sensor-embedded technologies that will change the lives of citizens dramatically in the future?<br><h1>Are government internet portals evolving towards more interaction, participation, and collaboration?

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractScholars and practitioners argue that the most important interactions between citizens and government happen at the local level. These relationships could become closer and more frequent with the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs). In fact, portals could be seen not only as channels for providing government information and services, but also as powerful tools to exchange information and knowledge between different social actors and government entities and to enable participation in collective decision-making efforts about important public affairs. For instance, social media and other Web 2.0 tools could provide new electronic channels for these interactions through their inclusion in local government portals. This paper argues that although important modifications to the organizational and institutional frameworks would be necessary, the potential for local electronic governance through networks of government and non-government actors via internet portals is clearly present. However, a very important first step would be the inclusion of more interaction, participation, and collaboration mechanisms in government portals. Similar to previous efforts with data from the U.S., this paper describes the results of a recent assessment of local government portals in Mexico. The conclusion is that progress toward citizen engagement is slow in local governments and there are very few efforts to increase interaction, participation, and collaboration channels on their portals. Most of them are still following the vision of information and services providers and a local electronic governance model is still in its very initial stages. It seems that e-government in municipalities is still more rhetoric and less reality, at least in some countries.<br><h1>Public participation in environmental governance in the Philippines: The challenge of consolidation in engaging the state</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Weena Gera, , <br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837714000490

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThis paper provides an overview of the extent of institutionalization of public participation in environmental governance in the Philippines using the three-pillar framework of the Aarhus Convention and Principle 10 Guidelines: access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters. It analyzes the shifting demarcations of public engagement and how these are defined by the interplay of institutional-legal structures with the country's political economy constraints. It argues that while the country appears to have a strong institutional design for public participation, there is a decisively low level of institutionalization of actual participatory processes that could not achieve substantive autonomy from power structures. A critical factor to this is the weakness in public deliberations and interactions among civil society groups in the country that constrain legitimacy of representation, coherence and necessary consolidation in engagements with government institutions. While pluralism is a key tenet of public participation, the situation in the Philippines shows the limitations of its application, particularly amid a patrimonial political context. Such weakness amid complexities in aggregating public interest allows particular interests to predominate in reconfigurations of the boundaries of involvement in environmental matters, displacing otherwise legitimate groups in the margins of collaborative governance.<br><h1>Listening to digital publics.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractSeveral studies underlined the impact of social media in the public sector, investigating the adoption process and uses of these digital platforms by public administrations. This paper adopts a public-oriented perspective to investigate citizens’ voices and engagement within 10 Italian municipalities’ Facebook Pages. In particular, it investigates the motivations to become Facebook fan of a municipality, and the variety of digital practices carried out by citizens to communicate and relate with this type of public administrations. The study was carried out through the administration of an online survey of 35 questions to 1196 Facebook users. The research proposes an active digital public typology (likers, mono interaction users, multi-interaction users, full interaction users) based on the extension of the activities that citizens carry out on municipalities’ Facebook Pages. The thematic analysis of the digital publics’ opinions reveals that citizens ask for a tangible and actual two-way communication with local administrations on social media. Theoretical and practical implications for public sector institutions using social media are discussed.<br><h1>Batik Fractal Community: Creative Engagement through Technology â</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Nancy Margried, <br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042815033315

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThis paper describes a social media system to prevent dengue in Sri Lanka and potentially in the rest of the South and Southeast Asia regions. The system integrates three concepts of public health prevention that have thus far been implemented only in silos. First, the predictive surveillance component uses a computer simulation to forewarn health authorities and the general public about impending disease outbreaks. The civic engagement component allows the general public to use social media tools to interact and engage with health authorities by aiding them in surveillance efforts by reporting symptoms, mosquito bites and breeding sites using smartphone technologies. The health communication component utilizes citizen data gathered from the first two components to disseminate customized health awareness messages to enhance knowledge and increase preventive behaviors among citizens. The system, known as “Mo-Buzz,” will be made available on a host of digital platforms like simple mobile phones, smart phones and a website. We present challenges and lessons learnt including content validation, stakeholder collaborations and applied trans-disciplinary research.<br><h1>Sound, mobility and landscapes of exhibition: radio-guided tours at the Science Museum, London, 1960–1964</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Jennifer Rich Author Vitae<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305748816000219

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractFrom 1960 to 1964 the Science Museum in London experimented with the technique of audio guide known as the radio-guided tour. The scheme formed part of a Museum-wide initiative dedicated to the education of the ‘average visitor’: a growing body of the museum-going public with a popular interest in science and technology. This paper positions the radio-guided tour within a period of rapid development at the Science Museum characterised by the reconfiguration of its landscapes of exhibition. It shows how the radio-guided tour helped to navigate new techniques of exhibition display, particularly that known as ‘exhibition as landscape’, which aimed to cultivate the appropriate sets of emotion necessary for an appreciation of, and, importantly, a feeling for, science and its applications in technology. The paper contributes to literature on the sonic and mobile makings of landscape, in particular that which has called for a critical phenomenological approach concerned with the social, cultural and political dimensions of embodied engagements with landscape practice. It also contributes to recent museum studies literature with its foregrounding of the body and the sensorium in the configuration of the spaces of knowledge at the museum.<br><h1>Eliciting situated feedback: A comparison of paper, web forms and public displays</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Jorge Goncalves, , Simo Hosio, Yong Liu, Vassilis Kostakos<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141938213001066

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractInteractive displays are becoming an increasingly popular civic engagement mechanism for collecting user feedback in urban settings. However, to date no study has investigated (i) how the situatedness of public displays affects the quantity and quality of collected feedback, and (ii) how public displays compare to traditional paper or web feedback mechanisms. We answer these research questions in a series of lab and field studies. We demonstrate that because people tend to approach this technology with no specific purpose in mind, the feedback collected with public displays is noisier than web and paper forms. However, we also show that public displays attract much more feedback than web and paper forms, and generate much more interest. Furthermore, we found that users appropriated our technology beyond its original purpose. Our analysis provides implications on the tradeoffs of using public displays as a feedback mechanism, and we discuss ways of improving the collected feedback using public displays.<br><h1>Rethinking localism in the broadband era: A participatory community development approach â</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Martha Fuentes-Bautista Author Vitae<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X13000427

More generally, it addresses the question of how states and municipal governments can employ video franchise resources to promote sustainable adoption and use of broadband services. Drawing on participatory approaches to community development, this paper offers a model of community participation in local information ecosystems to guide planning and evaluation of these interventions. Findings indicate that digital community media projects like channelAustin can help municipalities serve information needs of ethnically diverse local publics, while also promoting advanced digital skills, economic opportunities, civic engagement, and social cohesion. However, the article recommends that more attention be placed on community outreach, partnerships with nonprofits and other local public media, local curation of citizen-produced, digital content, and the consolidation of accessible online distribution channels through which residents can connect and deliberate about local issues.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractCities can be vibrant, innovative and exciting places to live but unplanned, high-carbon urban growth, alongside rising energy costs and increasing demands on service delivery, are putting pressure on local governments, threatening economic growth, poverty reduction and urban quality of life, and contributing to dangerous rises in global temperatures and subsequent climatic changes. It is understood that cities which pioneer a low emissions development model today will attract future investment, reduce energy costs and become efficient, inclusive, clean places to live and work tomorrow.Local governments have an important role in addressing non-technological barriers to support the transition to a renewable energy future. Two projects will illustrate approaches taken in this context.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractDuring 1965–1974 one million dwellings were built in Sweden, most of these financed by state housing loans and available for renting. Although most of these 850,000 apartments are considered decently maintained about 300,000 are considered in need of thorough refurbishment. This is a great opportunity for technological innovations, contributing to energy saving and climate mitigation on a broad scale. However, many of these estates have also been associated with spatial segregation, social exclusion and related challenges. The empirical focus of this article is on an attempt by a municipal housing company to approach the residents of a multi-family housing estate with a redevelopment scheme expressing a will to combine social, ecological and economic qualities under the brand “My Green Neighbourhood”. Drawing upon data describing the initial phase and the dialogue activities undertaken during the planning phase, and the residents’ reactions the study is conceptually framed by an eclectic approach inspired by the spatial triad of Lefebvre, Relph's notion of place identity, and Arnstein's ladder of citizen participation, including references to some related, recent works. Considering a common picture of municipal, multi-family housing in Sweden as a “success story” the case study is of relevance in the wider context of coping with the challenges of sustainable urban development. It is concluded that projects like this have a potential to decrease energy consumption substantially, as well as contributing to long-term financially sound management by housing companies. However, when it comes to social aspects of sustainability the picture becomes more complicated. First, most sitting tenants would have preferred a change in terms of proper maintenance and modest improvements. Second, most of them will not return to their apartments after rehabilitation, partly due to rising rents. Third, the position of the tenants was not very strong, instead planning rather had a tokenist bias. Fourth, the local government's social mix strategy has to be questioned on theoretical as well as empirical grounds. Despite these and other critical observations, My Green Neighbourhood should not be disregarded as just one more in a never-ending parade of low impact ad hoc projects. Up-scaling the experience of this and similar running projects would represent a substantial contribution to urban sustainable development, at least in terms of energy saving. Finally, to understand the complexities of a redevelopment planning process it is concluded that decisionmakers have to be very observant of the different time perspectives linked to the structural positions and interests of the various stakeholders, for example a building company's desire to make short time profits through major reconstruction, sitting tenants’ demand for sustainable maintenance and cautious refurbishment, local politicianÅ wish to create another social mix in the area, and a public housing company's attempt to reconcile the views of different actors.<br><h1>Improving the policy application of footprint indicators to support Europe's transition to a one planet economy: The development of the EUREAPA tool</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Katy Roelicha, b, Anne Owena, b, David Thompsonc, Elena Dawkinsa, Chris Westa, , <br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896971301228X

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractEnvironmentally extended multi-regional input–output (EE-MRIO) models provide us with a wealth of data relating to consumption-based environmental impacts at a national level. The results can identify the categories of consumption and sectors of production that contribute most to environmental impact allowing policy makers to prioritise intervention into particular areas. However, these data are not readily accessible to policy makers and civil society, making it difficult to extract and communicate the important messages it contains.The web-based tool — EUREAPA — was created as a usable, task-oriented interface to improve access to environmental and economic data held within a complex EE-MRIO model and make it more relevant to policy makers and civil society. The project team of scientists and IT specialists used an iterative, agile and participatory approach to engage potential end-users in the specification and testing of the tool.The engagement process identified two principal functions that were essential for the EUREAPA tool: viewing data and creating scenarios. The viewing data function allows users to analyse the wealth of data held within the model and present results from a range of perspectives. This helps to understand the causes of environmental pressure and identify priorities for policy intervention. The scenario function helps to communicate how changes in consumption and production might affect the future environmental impact of citizens of the EU, and facilitates long-term planning.Through this dialogue process the project has been able to ensure EUREAPA is relevant, user-friendly and fit-for-purpose. It is intended that EUREAPA will be adopted by policy makers and civil society as an important policy planning and assessment aid in the complex field of sustainable consumption and production.<br><h1>A business model perspective for ICTs in public engagement</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Panagiotis Panagiotopoulosa, , Author Vitae, Mutaz M.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractPublic institutions, in their efforts to promote meaningful citizen engagement, are increasingly looking at the democratic potential of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). Previous studies suggest that such initiatives seem to be impeded by socio-technical integration barriers such as low sustainability, poor citizen acceptance, coordination difficulties, lack of understanding and failure to assess their impact. Motivated by these shortcomings, the paper develops and applies a business model perspective as an interceding framework for analysis and evaluation. The underlying principle behind this approach is that it is not technology per se which determines success, but rather the way in which the business model of the technological artifact is configured and employed to achieve the strategic goals. The business model perspective is empirically demonstrated with the case of an online petitioning system implemented by a UK local authority. The case illustrates the importance of considering ICTs in public engagement from a holistic view to make them more manageable and assessable.<br><h1>Internet's impact on expert–citizen interactions in public policymaking—A meta analysis</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Lihua Yanga, , Author Vitae, G.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThis article studies the internet's impact on expert–citizen interactions in the process of public policymaking. It examines a possible solution to a classical democratic dilemma of citizens' right to participate versus citizens' ability to participate. Through a meta-analysis of the past studies on internet's impact on citizen participation in public policy making, the authors find that the internet has successfully reduced resource difference between policy experts and the citizens as promised. However, the technology itself does not provide all the answers. Exogenous factors such as personal characteristics, decision environment, and institutional factors all play a role in enhancing the impact of the internet. Continued education and institutional innovations are necessary to encourage citizen–expert collaboration and reduce resource difference between the citizens and policy experts. Also, more clearly defined and systematic theoretical and empirical studies are needed to help facilitate our understanding of efficient citizen–expert interactions in public policy making by way of the internet technology. 1<br><h1>Development of CCS Projects in Poland.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractPoland has made concrete promises to the EU to reduce its CO2 emissions within the next years by a considerable amount. CCS technology could provide a way to reduce CO2 emissions significantly without slowing the country's economic growth. Social acceptance at potential storage sites for CO2 has proven to be decisive for the development of CCS projects in other European countries. Therefore, it is important to gain insight into the perceptions that local stakeholders have with regard to the implementation of CCS in Poland. This paper presents results from risk communication activities which were conducted during the EU FP7 SiteChar project at a prospective CO2 storage site in Poland. These activities included a social site characterization as well as public engagement activities. The aim was to analyze the local public perception of CCS among citizens and stakeholders as well as to inform community representatives and the local public about CCS technology and to involve them in the planning process for the prospective CCS project. The research showed that in local contexts, it is necessary to include local stakeholders directly in planning processes in order to build trust, that a generally positive public climate towards CCS is not sufficient for local acceptance of CCS projects, and that a thorough social site characterization can provide starting points for future communication activities.<br><h1>The construction of technology and place: Concentrating solar power conflicts in the United States</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Sharlissa Moorea, , , Edward J.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThere is sufficient space in the United States to site large-scale renewable energy technologies, yet siting decisions are often highly contentious with conflicting land-use values. This paper examines conflicts surrounding large-scale solar power siting through the lens of place-making and the co-shaping of place and technology. It traces the place-based conflicts over the Ivanpah solar power plant in California over five years, from designed to operational, in order to understand the evolving public engagement process in issues of place. Place-making can aid in understanding conflicts over renewable energy siting by interpreting stakeholder values. Through the place-making process, both the place and technology were shaped but could only be bent so far until they became something else entirely, making the negotiation of trade-offs difficult and the object of the negotiation a moving target. Moving forward, the challenge should be addressed that the technology and place must be sufficiently concrete to engage the public in siting decisions but accomplished early enough to avoid polarization and to facilitate mutual accommodation. Innovative forms of place-based participation are needed that would help citizens to debate the properties and trade-offs of energy systems in constructive ways downstream without damaging or breaking trust.<br><h1>Being relevant: Practical guidance for early career researchers interested in solving conservation problems</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>J.M.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractIn a human-altered world where biodiversity is in decline and conservation problems abound, there is a dire need to ensure that the next generation of conservation scientists have the knowledge, skills, and training to address these problems. So called “early career researchers” (ECRs) in conservation science have many challenges before them and it is clear that the status quo must change to bridge the knowledge–action divide. Here we identify thirteen practical strategies that ECRs can employ to become more relevant. In this context, “relevance” refers to the ability to contribute to solving conservation problems through engagement with practitioners, policy makers, and stakeholders. Conservation and career strategies outlined in this article include the following: thinking ‘big picture’ during conservation projects; embracing various forms of knowledge; maintaining positive relationships with locals familiar with the conservation issue; accepting failure as a viable (and potentially valuable) outcome; daring to be creative; embracing citizen science; incorporating interdisciplinarity; promoting and practicing pro-environmental behaviours; understanding financial aspects of conservation; forming collaboration from the onset of a project; accepting the limits of technology; ongoing and effective networking; and finally, maintaining a positive outlook by focusing on and sharing conservation success stories. These strategies move beyond the generic and highlight the importance of continuing to have an open mind throughout the entire conservation process, from establishing one’s self as an asset to embracing collaboration and interdisciplinary work, and striving to push for professional and personal connections that strengthen personal career objectives.<br><h1>A sentiment analysis of U.S. local government tweets: The connection between tone and citizen involvement</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Staci M.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractAs social media tools become more popular at all levels of government, more research is needed to determine how the platforms can be used to create meaningful citizen–government collaboration. Many entities use the tools in one-way, push manners. The aim of this research is to determine if sentiment (tone) can positively influence citizen participation with government via social media. Using a systematic random sample of 125 U.S. cities, we found that positive sentiment is more likely to engender digital participation but this was not a perfect one-to-one relationship. Some cities that had an overall positive sentiment score and displayed a participatory style of social media use did not have positive citizen sentiment scores. We argue that positive tone is only one part of a successful social media interaction plan, and encourage social media managers to actively manage platforms to use activities that spur participation.<br><h1>Chapter Two – The Visualisation of Ecological Networks, and Their Use as a Tool for Engagement, Advocacy and Management</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Michael J.O.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractEcological systems comprise of individuals and species interacting with each other and their environment, and these interactions combine to form complex networks. The maintenance of biodiversity and many ecosystem functions depend upon these ecological interactions. Humans, their crops and livestock can also be considered as part of these networks of interactions making network analysis valuable for considering the resilience of ecosystem services, i.e., the benefits we gain from nature. Networks are visually appealing and visualisation can attract attention and inform, both to communicate overall messages and provide comparisons between networks. There are many different approaches and layouts for visualising networks, but there is little research to help guide best practice. Ultimately though, best practice should be to ensure that messages are supported by evidence and clearly communicated with reference to the competence of the audience. Given the appeal of visualisations and the importance of networks in communicating the interdependence of species (including humans), ecological networks and their visualisation can be used to support excellent public engagement and can be used to enhance the value of citizen science, in which people actively contribute to scientific research. Network approaches could also be valuable for engagement with decision-makers and stakeholders, including their application to complex socio-economic systems, especially where co-production of network visualisations could provide evidence-based overviews of data. In summary, ecological networks and their visualisation are an important tool for scientific inquiry, communication and engagement with even greater potential than has currently been realised.<br><h1>Participatory or deliberative democracy?

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractUsing the structural equation modeling method (N = 811), this study explores the structural relationships among online news consumption, political participation and social trust, with a focus on the mediating effects of online users’ deliberative perceptions and news-related online interactive activities. The analysis confirms that users’ perceptions of online deliberation exert a significant mediating effect on users’ levels of news consumption, political participation, and social trust. Users’ interactive civic messaging behaviors, on the other hand, solely enhance participatory intentions. The findings also show that the consumption of political news and the consumption of entertainment news have different effects on users’ perceptions of online deliberation, social trust, and political participation. Specifically, while political news has a direct and relatively strong influence on participation, entertainment news has a limited and indirect effect on participation. Online interactive activities are negatively associated with users’ perceived competency for online deliberation. Further implications of the study are also discussed.<br><h1>Fostering citizen deliberations on the social acceptability of renewable fuels policy: The case of advanced lignocellulosic biofuels in Canada</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Holly Longstaffa, 1, David M.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractIt is widely recognized that a lack of social acceptance is likely to hinder the ability of governments to achieve policy targets concerning renewable energies. In this paper, we discuss the results of a pre- and post-test online survey that was conducted as part of the 2012 “Advanced Biofuels” deliberative democracy public engagement event in Montréal, Québec. The event sough to foster public learning and discussion in order to produce socially acceptable policy input for one type of renewable energy: advanced lignocellulosic biofuels. Survey results show that the majority of participants were strongly supportive of advanced lignocellulosic biofuel development in Canada after the deliberative event. By the end of the event, support also grew for current Canadian biofuel policies and many agreed that increasing biofuel production should be widely supported by the Canadian public. However, despite this support, about two thirds of participants revealed that they did not feel included in government decisions about biofuels. The gap between support after inclusive deliberation and expressed exclusion from Canadian government decisions points to the importance of fostering future citizen engagements in this area of renewable energy policy.<br><h1>Citizen participation and the uses of mobile technology in radio broadcasting</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Rey G.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThe continuous and unforeseeable mutations in relation to the use of land have led to different types of adjacencies between land uses. These often cause considerable nuisance which influences how people think about their environment. The aim of our study is to explore the similarities and differences in the assessment of land-use associations by local people and experts. We investigated the problems or nuisance (noise, insecurity, odor, waste disposal, unwanted animals, health risk, visual discomfort and unorganized trade) caused by the adjacency of residential to a range of six non-residential land uses (industry, commercial, transport infrastructure, landfill, medical and recreational). Face-to face written surveys were conducted with local people from 33 settlements in Romania (52% urban areas) and an online survey was distributed to experts of different professional activities. A multiple correspondence analysis was carried out to explore similarities and differences in the assessment of land-use associations by the two groups of actors. The results showed (i) differences, where local people positively assessed some land-use associations (industry vs. residential, commercial vs. residential and transport infrastructure vs. residential), while experts assessed them negatively; (ii) similarities, where both local people and experts had similar negative assessments on the same land-use association (landfill-residential), as well as (iii) similarities, where both groups had similar positive assessments on the same land-use associations (medical-residential and recreational-residential). Therefore, understanding the patterns in local people’s and experts’ assessment towards different adjacent land uses potentially causing nuisance could provide additional support for the complicated planning processes which are often overriding the public participation. This means that motivated and informed citizens along with experts’ evaluation should be part of the planning process in order to achieve effective land-use policies.<br><h1>Cities in Citizens’ Hands â</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Leonel Morgadoa, b, , , Rui Rodriguesa, e, António Coelhoa, e, Olga Maganob, c, Tânia Calçadad, e, Paula Trigueiros Cunhaf, Cynthia Echaveg, Olga Kordash, Sara Samai, Jennifer Oliverj, Jim Angj, Farzin Deravij, Ricardo Bentoa, k, Luís Ramosk<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915031348

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractWe propose a new paradigm for public participation in urban planning, a field which presents significant challenges for public understanding and participation. Our approach is based on leveraging the rich diversity of meaning associated with cultural gestures, traditions, folklore, and rituals, and using them in augmented reality systems, in order for citizens’ to explore, understand, and communicate the complex, systemic ideas and concepts associated with urban planning.At an immediate level, this approach holds the potential for enabling increased public awareness of what is at stake in urban planning - both on the part of citizens and on the part of public officials, policy-makers, and decision-makers – and consequently enhancing understanding and improving participation in public life and citizenship. It may also open up a new field of research and development in human-computer interaction, to leverage the richness of meaning and modes of expression which exist in various cultures and societies, rather than ignoring them and imposing dumbed-down or prescribed command methods. Thus, it aims to facilitate new levels of empowerment of users in the use of digital systems and data. The active utilization of cultural meaning in gestures, rituals, and social practices may also support and promote better inclusion and participation of minority groups and migrant communities in contemporary, technology-rich life.<br><h1>Geospatial Cyberinfrastructure: Past, present and future</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Chaowei Yanga, , , Robert Raskinb, Michael Goodchildc, Mark Gahegand<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971510000268

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractA Cyberinfrastructure (CI) is a combination of data resources, network protocols, computing platforms, and computational services that brings people, information, and computational tools together to perform science or other data-rich applications in this information-driven world. Most science domains adopt intrinsic geospatial principles (such as spatial constraints in phenomena evolution) for large amounts of geospatial data processing (such as geospatial analysis, feature relationship calculations, geospatial modeling, geovisualization, and geospatial decision support). Geospatial CI (GCI) refers to CI that utilizes geospatial principles and geospatial information to transform how research, development, and education are conducted within and across science domains (such as the environmental and Earth sciences). GCI is based on recent advancements in geographic information science, information technology, computer networks, sensor networks, Web computing, CI, and e-research/e-science. This paper reviews the research, development, education, and other efforts that have contributed to building GCI in terms of its history, objectives, architecture, supporting technologies, functions, application communities, and future research directions. Similar to how GIS transformed the procedures for geospatial sciences, GCI provides significant improvements to how the sciences that need geospatial information will advance. The evolution of GCI will produce platforms for geospatial science domains and communities to better conduct research and development and to better collect data, access data, analyze data, model and simulate phenomena, visualize data and information, and produce knowledge. To achieve these transformative objectives, collaborative research and federated developments are needed for the following reasons: (1) to address social heterogeneity to identify geospatial problems encountered by relevant sciences and applications, (2) to analyze data for information flows and processing needed to solve the identified problems, (3) to utilize Semantic Web to support building knowledge and semantics into future GCI tools, (4) to develop geospatial middleware to provide functional and intermediate services and support service evolution for stakeholders, (5) to advance citizen-based sciences to reflect the fact that cyberspace is open to the public and citizen participation will be essential, (6) to advance GCI to geospatial cloud computing to implement the transparent and opaque platforms required for addressing fundamental science questions and application problems, and (7) to develop a research and development agenda that addresses these needs with good federation and collaboration across GCI communities, such as government agencies, non-government organizations, industries, academia, and the public.<br><h1>Mobile social media for smart grids customer engagement: Emerging trends and challenges</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>A.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractEnergy efficiency improvement is one of the most important targets to be achieved on every society as a whole and in power system in particular. This target could bring renewable energy resources technologies closer to the ‘Smart Energy Communities’; that would allow the active participation of the so-called ×³prosumers×³ in a genuinely open market. Accordingly, there is a need to develop strategies to motivate and involve citizens in the future electricity system. Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have an important role to play in reducing the energy intensity and therefore increasing the energy efficiency of the economy, contributing to sustainable growth. The emphasis of the smart grid in social media through mobile apps could give utilities a collection of new instruments to improve their customer engagement. To preserve long-term customer fidelity, utilities should transform themselves from energy suppliers to energy service advisor. Utilities can draw useful lessons from most valuable brands on how to expand their digital customer experience initiatives. Therefore, this paper discusses and offers guidance for utilities in creating a social roadmap for the smart grid, emphasizing prosumer role.<br><h1>Digital media use and participation leadership in social protests: The case of Tiananmen commemoration in Hong Kong â</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Francis L.F.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractDuring the process of social mobilization for contentious collective actions, some ordinary citizens may play the role of participation leaders by making an early participation decision and calling upon others to join the collective action. This study extends the literature on the impact of digital media on political participation by examining if digital media can influence not whether individuals would participate in offline protests or not, but whether people would take up the role of participation leaders in such protests. Using the annual rally in Hong Kong commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen movement in China as a case study, usage of Facebook, microblogging services, and online alternative media are found to contribute to online political communication activities, which in turn lead to participation leadership. Further analysis shows that the impact of online political communication activities on participation leadership exists only among the young rally participants.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractInformation and Communication Technology (ICT) use is becoming an ever more popular way to involve citizens in political decision making. And yet, despite their recently increasing number, few eParticipation initiatives have achieved their intended aims. If nothing else, this shows that the internal processes, challenges and opportunities of using ICT to engage citizens in politics deserve further examination. The present paper attempts to undertake such an investigation by analysing Italy's Five Star Movement, a mass-eParticipation-based political organisation recently founded by private citizens. Using an interpretive case-study approach, this paper assesses the goals, participation, technology use, internal governance, external consequences, and challenges endemic to employing ICT in citizen engagement, to answer the following question: what consequences, challenges and opportunities does mass-eParticipation present to organisational stakeholders?

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThe German Energiewende (Energy Transition) poses major challenges to all parties involved. Public participation can contribute to the understanding of these challenges and their positive resolution. It is not suitable, however, to expect public acceptance for predetermined solutions. Participation presupposes openness about options. If this does not exist, one can resort to methods of communication that attempt to convince affected citizens of the necessity of adopting a planned measure. Yet if there is room for choosing among options, participation may create a foundation for broad acceptance of a jointly determined solution to pressing problems. Participative procedures that follow the model of analytic-deliberative discourse, by integrating scientific expertise with ethical and moral consideration, are particularly promising. A forward-looking model is drawn from the use of both online and traditional face-to-face methods of interaction, combining the advantages of both methods. An inclusive planning culture based on cooperation and integration is a promising way to achieve fair and effective implementation of the Energiewende.<br><h1>The IEA CCS Technology Roadmap: One Year On</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Juho Lipponena, Keith Burnarda, Brendan Becka, John Galeb, Bob Peglerc<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610211008502

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractIn October 2009, the International Energy Agency’s CCS Technology Roadmap was launched at the Carbon Sequestration Leadership forum (CSLF) Ministerial Meeting in London. The Roadmap builds on the IEA BLUE Map scenario that leads to the stabilisation of CO2 emissions at 450 ppm by 2050. Achieving this scenario will require an energy technology revolution involving a portfolio of solutions: greater energy efficiency, increased renewable energy technologies and nuclear power, and the near decarbonisation of fossil fuel-based power generation via carbon capture and storage (CCS). In this scenario CCS contributes almost 20% to the total emissions reductions required in 2050. Recommendations are made in the IEA CCS Roadmap on what is required to achieve this level of deployment not only technically, but also from a financial and regulatory point of view as well as in terms of public engagement and international collaboration, including the sharing of knowledge. This paper looks at progress made against these recommendations in the 12 months since the release of the roadmap. •Analysis undertaken by the IEA consistently identifies a significant role for CCS in mitigating global CO2 emissions. IEA analysis suggests that there will be a need to capture and store 10 Gt CO2 per year in 2050, from 3400 projects globally to achieve the BLUE Map emissions reduction targets.•Significant progress is being made to launch large-scale demonstration facilities across the globe, with some 80 large-scale integrated demonstration projects identified. As of April 2010, public funding commitments were in the range of USD 26.6 billion to USD 36.1 billion.•While 5500 km of CO2 pipelines already exist and further infrastructure development is planned, it is however clear that to enable large-scale deployment of CCS, more joint planning of CO2 transportation infrastructure is required globally.•The status and availability of data on CO2 storage varies significantly around the world and is potentially a major constraint to rapid, widespread CCS deployment. In regions with the potential to store large volumes of CO2, a concerted effort will be required to characterise the basins in sufficient detail.•Much progress has been achieved in the legal and regulatory area. The first movers in establishing legal frameworks have generally been OECD countries. It is now important that the large emerging economies start developing their legal and regulatory frameworks.•Public awareness and acceptance is a key element in making CCS possible. Public concerns are legitimate and require a close dialogue and sharing of information with the local population. While companies developing transport and storage will need to lead on the engagement processes, governments and politicians have a vital role to play.•Several initiatives are in place for international dialogue and collaboration on the development and deployment of CCS.•While much progress has been made, many challenges still remain if CCS is to deliver at the scale required. The challenges are well-known and require concerted action by industry, governments, international organisations and civil society. Continued political leadership remains absolutely essential.<br><h1>Social Software Infrastructure for e-Participation</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Lukasz Porwol, Author Vitae, Adegboyega Ojo Author Vitae, John G.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractDespite the ubiquity of e-Participation initiatives, efforts in mainstreaming social media-based and citizen-led political deliberations are still limited. Consequently, there is little opportunity to leverage, study and understand the expected mutual re-shaping of deliberations on traditional e-Participation and spontaneous citizen discussions on social media platforms. This mutual re-shaping phenomenon also referred to as “duality of e-Participation”; requires inter alia a Social Software Infrastructure (SSI) to enable decision makers in government access relevant information about ongoing citizen discussions on social media platforms. This article describes the design of such SSI. The design is based on a comprehensive set of requirements specifying relevant technical capabilities required to support a number of core facets of an integrated e-Participation model. In addition, the paper describes the software components for realizing the design and how an implementation of the SSI was employed as part of an e-Participation initiative in Europe. We conclude with some of the socio-technical challenges associated with implementing of some of the components of the Social Software Infrastructure.<br><h1>Factors affecting openness of local government websites: Examining the differences across planning, finance and police departments</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Nilay Yavuza, , Author Vitae, Eric W.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThe use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in public organizations increasingly holds the potential to improve transparency, accountability, and public participation, by providing a more effective and efficient disclosure of information to the citizens and organizations and by providing channels for interaction with the government. While transparency and interactivity features of government websites constitute two critical elements for public participation and democracy facilitated by web-based technologies, little research has been done to explain why some public organizations choose to deploy website technology more openly with these features. This paper aims to examine the managerial, organizational, and environmental factors that are related to variation in transparency and interactivity features of local government websites, which we believe are key dimensions to governmental website openness. The paper first develops a literature informed conceptual model of governmental website openness and then tests this model using data from a national survey of 850 government managers in 500 cities. The model results are compared across three different departments: community development, finance, and police department. Overall findings indicate that higher website openness is positively related to increased frequency of public participation in agency decision making and civil society influence, increased technical capacity, lower organizational control, and higher perceived usefulness of website technology. In addition, due to differences in the operating contexts of the departments, the effects of organizational control, technical capacity, environmental influences, and perceived usefulness of website technology on governmental website openness tend to differ by the type of department.<br><h1>Towards participatory geographic information systems for community-based environmental decision making</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Piotr Jankowski <br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479708001229

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThis article discusses the potential of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to become an information technology enabling groups of people to participate in decisions shaping their communities and promoting sustainable use of natural resources. It explains the concept of participation in the context of planning and decision making. In this context Participatory GIS (PGIS) offers tools that can be used to help the public become meaningfully involved in decision making processes affecting their communities. Following an overview of research on PGIS and its current status the article presents two recent studies of PGIS in water resource planning; one involving the use of computer generated maps representing simple information structures and the other involving the use of more sophisticated information tools. The synthesis of both studies provides the bases for discussing the prospects of PGIS to empower citizens in making decisions about their communities and resources.<br><h1>The Impact of Social Media in the Public Sector â</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Maria Karakiza, <br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042815012744

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractIn recent years the flood of new technologies and the expanded use of social media have already changed the way people communicate with each other. New technologies and social media, however, can change the communication between Government and the citizens as they contribute decisively to the transformation of public administration towards a new and open format that will be characterized by: a) active participation of citizens in public affairs, b) close collaboration between public services and between government and citizens, and c) transparency of the State activities. The transition to an open governance is a process with many stages. This paper presents different models of e-government and open government referred to in the literature, and proposes a new model of open government. Furthermore, in this paper we will try to answer questions such as: What are the guidelines and commitments to Greece, Europe and the world? What is the level of penetration of new technologies in public administration in different countries and which ones are actively moving towards a model of open government? We will also present representative efforts developed in Greece and abroad that attempt to serve the principles of transparency, active participation, innovation and collaboration in the public sector. Finally suggestions and recommendations are made for further study and research.<br><h1>Collective intelligence in law enforcement – The WikiCrimes system</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Vasco Furtadoa, d, , , Leonardo Ayresa, Marcos de Oliveirac, Eurico Vasconcelosb, Carlos Caminhaa, Johnatas D’Orleansa, Mairon Belchiora<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025509003454

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractCollaboration is on the rise, primordially leveraged by the Web 2.0 in which the difference between information producer and consumer decreases significantly. In this paper we describe WikiCrimes, an example of a Web 2.0 application that offers a collaborative environment based on the use and direct manipulation of maps, in order to register and research criminal events. WikiCrimes is driven by three goals: (i) to give more transparency and publicity to criminal information, (ii) to provide means for citizen prevention, and (iii) to reduce the phenomenon of under-reporting (crimes that are not notified to authorities). In the paper we pay particular attention to the fact that in this context, finding the equilibrium between people’s participation and information credibility is crucial. Anonymous mass collaboration is the easiest way to receive information; however, the credibility of the received information is depreciated, because the source of information is unknown. We particularly concentrate on the ways we have created to keep the “participation vs. reliability of information” trade-off at good level. The reputation model is the main component created with this purpose. The experiences and the obstacles we are facing in the implementation of the project are the subjects of discussion and analyses.<br><h1>Media use during conflicts: Information seeking and political efficacy during the 2012 Mexican elections</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Andrea L.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractPublic access to accurate and reliable information is fundamental to democracy and democratic decision-making. In emerging democracies, during political crises or controversial elections, reliable information is often difficult to obtain. In authoritarian regimes, citizens' perceptions of information reliability are tightly linked to trust in government, and both are typically low. Open government policies help build trust that is essential during protests or contentious elections. Uses and gratifications (U&G) theory states that people use diverse media to try to satisfy their need for reliable information. Gratifying this need is tied to the larger concept of political information efficacy (PIE), i.e., the belief a person holds about him/herself as being politically informed and competent to participate in political thought and action. We investigated these inter-related concepts by administering a survey to an opportunity sample of young adults at a public state university in Mexico. We find that respondents perceived that information from face-to-face and telephone communication with members of their social network, as well as online sources were the most reliable. Information from offline sources, such as TV and newspapers, especially pro-government sources, were the least reliable. Further, the information factors of availability, reliability, influence and sharing had positive relationships with PIE. These results suggest that in conditions of uncertain political information, social networks and online information sources are essential to political information efficacy democratic political participation.Categories and subject descriptorsH.4.3 [Information Systems Applications]: Communications Applications (e.g., email, information browsers, bulletin boards).General termsMeasurement, Reliability, Experimentation, Human Factors<br><h1>Social media adoption and resulting tactics in the U.S. federal government</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Ines Mergel, Author Vitae<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X13000063

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractIn 2009, the departments in the executive branch of the U.S. federal government received the presidential marching order to “harness new technologies” in order to become more transparent, collaborative and participatory. Given this mandate, this article sets out to provide insights from qualitative interviews with social media directors to understand the factors that influence internal adoption decisions to use social media applications, such as Facebook, Twitter, or blogs. Three distinct factors influence the adoption decisions of social media directors: information about best practices in their informal network of peers, passive observations of perceived best practices in the public and private sector, and “market-driven” citizen behavior. The resulting adoption tactics include: (1) representation, (2) engagement, and (3) networking. The findings point to the need for higher degrees of formalized knowledge sharing when it comes to disruptive technology innovations such as social media use in highly bureaucratic communication environments. Recommendations based on the lessons learned are provided for practitioners and social media researchers to develop social media tactics for different organizational purposes in government.<br><h1>Crowdsourcing civility: A natural experiment examining the effects of distributed moderation in online forums</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Cliff Lampea, , Author Vitae, Paul Zubeb, Author Vitae, Jusil Leec, Author Vitae, Chul Hyun Parkc, Author Vitae, Erik Johnstonc, Author Vitae<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X14000021

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractParticipation in discussions about the public interest can be enhanced by technology, but can also create an environment in which participants are overwhelmed by the quantity, quality, and diversity of information and arguments. Political participation is at a greater disadvantage than non-political activities in that participants from different parties already start out with established differences, which requires them to reach some form of common ground before progress can be made. Those seeking authentic deliberation are discouraged to participate when confronted with uncivil and inflammatory rhetoric. These issues are often exacerbated in online discussions, where lack of identity cues and low barriers to entry can lead to heightened incivility between participants, often labeled as “flaming” and “trolling”. This paper explores the extent to which moderator systems, tools online discussion forums use to manage contributions, can reduce information overload and encourage civil conversations in virtual discussion spaces. Using the popular website Slashdot as an example of sound moderation in a public discourse setting, we found that users move toward consensus about which and how comments deserve to be moderated. Using these findings, we explore how transferable these systems are for participation in public matters specifically to the unique attributes of political discussion. Slashdot's political forum provides a comparison group that allowed us to find quantitative and qualitative differences in political posting, comments, and moderation. Our results show that large scale, civil participation is possible with a distributed moderation system that enables regularly lively debates to be conducted positively because the system provides tools for people to enforce norms of civility.<br><h1>Smart grids, smart users?

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractSmart grids are a key feature of future energy scenarios, with the overarching goal of better aligning energy generation and demand. The work presented here considers the role of the user in such systems, and the contexts in which such roles might emerge. The data used is drawn from focus groups with 72 participants, using novel scenario techniques to contextualise smart grid technologies in domestic settings. Two contrasting visions of the smart grid are presented, a centralised system based on current institutional arrangements, and an alternative system in which decentralisation of generation and control is pursued. Using the concepts of ‘energy consumer’ and ‘energy citizen’, the paper considers what forms of engagement are likely to be generated by the two visions. We propose that smart grid designs must look beyond simply the technology and recognise that a smart user who is actively engaged with energy is critical to much of what is proposed by demand side management. We conclude that the energy citizen holds out most promise in this regard. The implications of this for policy makers are discussed.<br><h1>Welfare and technology in the network society—Concerns for the future of welfare</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Nikhil Shah <br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001632871200105X

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThe last decade of explosive innovation thanks to the growth of information and communication technologies (ICT) has left the public sector, and particularly the provision of welfare services, largely unchanged. Where socialising, commerce, information finding, entertainment and travel have all undergone profound structural transformations, the workings of government have not seen a similar shift. To be sure, the pace of decision-making has been sped up, as it has elsewhere, by Blackberries, and a small number of services are delivered online. But these services are still based around their offline equivalents, and usually aim simply at cutting the costs associated with their delivery by moving online. While this will continue to be a key motivation for the digitisation of government, other more fundamental developments are set to take place which will herald new online-only services, and which will encourage radical decentralisation of power.The first part of this paper will look at the private sector's experience over the past decade for clues as to why the public sector has moved relatively slowly, and likely directions of development in coming years. We will also here present evidence from our own forecasts of the likely narrowing of the digital divide. The next two sections will then deal with future developments in more detail, firstly looking at ICT's future role in welfare service delivery, and secondly at the ways in which it might be used for greater citizen engagement, and the reshaping of power structures that will result from this. The final section will examine some conflicts that arise from this reorientation away from the centre.<br><h1>Understanding risks, benefits, and strategic alternatives of social media applications in the public sector</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Sergio Picazo-Vela, Author Vitae, Isis Gutiérrez-Martínez Author Vitae, Luis Felipe Luna-Reyes Author Vitae<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X12001025

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractSocial media such as blogs, microblogs or electronic social networks can transform the ways in which we relate to other people and organizations. Government organizations are experimenting with social media to communicate with their constituents, and many analysts see in these media a powerful set of tools to reinvent government–citizen relationships. In this paper, we present the perceptions of risks, benefits and strategic guidelines about social media applications gathered from 250 public servants from Central Mexico, most of them working in information technology, as web masters or responding to Freedom of Information Act requests. The conclusions of the analysis are 1) that governments' participation in social media may result in improved communication and citizen participation, more transparency, and transfer of best practices among government agencies; 2) that a good implementation strategy is necessary to realize these benefits and to avoid risks; and 3) that the implementation of social media highlights the importance of updating laws and regulations, and of promoting changes in government culture and organizational practices.<br><h1>The future of public participation: Empirical analysis from the viewpoint of policy-makers</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Sascha Alexander Wagnera, , Author Vitae, Sebastian Vogtb, Author Vitae, Rüdiger Kabstb, Author Vitae<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162516000524

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractIn recent years, social changes have significantly increased the importance of public participation, and technological developments have delivered additional opportunities for participation in political decision-making processes in Western democracies. Nevertheless, despite discussions on this topic, little is known about the desirability of future developments in public decision-making from the viewpoint of policy-makers. Our study provides an evaluation of such future developments by allowing 171 German policy-makers to discuss ten projections concerning future public participation in an online-based Delphi survey. We thus obtain knowledge about expected developments, their desirability and their impact on political actions in the future. Moreover, on the basis of the collected data and 1415 text responses, we are able to identify the proponents and sceptics of these developments. We also determine the influential characteristics related to these developments and discuss power-related barriers to future developments. Thereby, our study provides guidance for policy-makers and civil servants. Moreover, we carry out the first comprehensive assessment of the future of public participation from the perspective of 171 elected representatives using a Delphi approach. The results obtained are not only of interest to German policy-makers; rather, they provide relevant information for all democratic countries with elements of public participation.<br><h1>To comment or not to comment?: How virality, arousal level, and commenting behavior on YouTube videos affect civic behavioral intentions</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Saleem Alhabasha, , , Jong-hwan Baekb, Carie Cunninghamc, Amy Hagerstromd<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215004070

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractAn experiment investigated the effects of commenting behavior, virality, and arousal level on anti-cyberbullying civic behavioral intentions. Participants (N = 98) were exposed to cyberbullying-related YouTube videos that varied in arousal level (low vs. high), number of views (low vs. high), and commenting behavior where they either commented on the video or did not comment after watching it. Participants expressed greater Civic Behavioral Intentions (CBI) upon exposure to highly than lowly arousing videos. Additionally, they expressed greater CBI when instructed to comment on highly arousing videos with high than low views, while those who did not comment on highly arousing videos expressed greater CBI upon exposure to videos with low than high views. As for lowly arousing videos, participants who were instructed to comment expressed greater CBI when the video had low than high views, while those who did not comment did not differ in CBI as a function of the number of views. Viral behavioral intentions (VBI) were the strongest predictors of CBI with degrees that varied as a function of commenting behavior, virality, arousal level, and the interactions among them.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractDespite over a decade-long experience of implementing e-Participation initiatives, there have been limited efforts so far to develop a detailed, comprehensive conceptualization for e-Participation considered from three distinct perspectives: as democratic process, a project and a deliberation platform. Current e-Participation literature is replete with fragmented models, which only partially describe aspects of e-Participation with main focus on structuring the “e-Participation” concept as a domain. This has made consistent descriptions and comparative analysis of e-Participation initiatives difficult, thus hindering the overall evolution of e-Participation. Consequently, no comprehensive, formal, executable e-Participation Ontology exists, that could be directly leveraged to facilitate operations of e-Participation initiatives or improving communication and knowledge exchange between similar e-Participation initiatives. In addition, current generation of e-Participation models does not explicitly support the emerging phenomenon of spontaneous, citizen-led e-Participation, in particular hosted on the social media platforms. This work bridges this gap by providing a practical, yet sufficiently detailed, conceptualization along with corresponding formal and executable ontology for next generation e-Participation. These semantic models cover the core facets of e-Participation — as a democratic process, an initiative and a sociotechnical system. The developed models also explicitly support the integrated citizen- and government-led model of e-Participation. For demonstration and validation, we employed the developed e-Participation Formal Ontology as a “design artefact” to describe two e-Participation initiatives at Local Government and European levels.<br><h1>We don’t Know What We don’t Know—But We Can Learn: Lessons Learned from Afghanistan on Women, Peace and Security â</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Sheila M.Q.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>Abstract“You don’t understand our culture” was the mantra working with both the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Interior of Afghanistan from May 2010-May 2014. “You can’t push gender integration on this culture; they’re not ready for it” was the mantra from my US military brethren working alongside of me. What was lacking was education and an understanding of who was actually formulating and enabling the culture of Afghanistan to treat women as third-and fourth-class citizens. This paper presents a journalistic account of the author's experience working as a Senior Advisor to the Deputy Minister of Interior (MOI) of Afghanistan for Administration and Support (Logistics), Senior Gender Advisor to the Ministry of Interior and to the Commander, NATO Training Mission/Combined Security Transition Command Afghanistan. In particular, the paper will discuss the author's opinions and personal lessons learned on Women, Peace, and Security (WPS). These lessons learned include how UN Security Resolution 1325 and the use of security gender analyses play a significant role in conflict resolution and stability operations when dealing with nonwestern cultures. The paper will also discuss the use of funding, education, technology, key leader engagements, and how they affect cultural change when it comes to WPS. Lastly, it will highlight the defense and security applications as to why there must be an increase in the footprint in the Defense Stability and Humanitarian Affairs Department on Women, Peace and Security.<br><h1>Context clues for the stall of the Citizens’ Initiative: lessons for opening up e-participation development practice</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Iryna Susha, Author Vitae, Åke Grönlund Author Vitae<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X14000860

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThe European Union recently launched an innovative participatory mechanism allowing its citizens across Europe get together and set the agenda for policy-making in Brussels. The tool – the European Citizens’ Initiative – was labelled as “most direct and digital” ever in the history of European democratic experimentation as it made it possible to collect signatures (of which it is required not less than 1 million) in favour of an initiative via the internet (e-collection). Launched on 1 April 2012 the ECI was met with major enthusiasm in Brussels, but soon stumbled over serious difficulties as the organisers on the ground were unable to set up their online collection systems. The present paper looks into this ICT-related crisis from the point of reference of e-democracy theory based on the findings of a qualitative case-study. As a deliverable, it offers an understanding of factors and stakeholder rationales which shaped the design and implementation of the digital dimension of the ECI (iECI).<br><h1>Participation – In what?

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractRecent literature has pointed to the way in which new media such as the internet and mobile phones have the capacity to enable more participatory and interactive communication, either through user-generated content or through a broader participation of audiences in mainstream media’s content production. This potential is celebrated even more in contexts in which there is deemed to be a lack of political accountability or limited consultation of citizens by government. This article investigates the extent to which new technologies have changed the quality of audience participation in radio content production in Zambia. Engaging with literature on participation in media studies as well as development studies and based on interviews with station managers, producers and presenters of six radio stations in Zambia, the article examines both the opportunities and limits of the use of internet and mobile phones in audience participation. It argues that there is a need to situate these practices within a broader corporate logic in which participation is not merely about adding more voices but also feeds into radio stations’ commercial strategies of increasing revenue and accessing personal data of listeners through SMS and social media.<br><h1>Success factors in designing eParticipation initiatives</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Eleni Panopoulou, , Efthimios Tambouris , Konstantinos Tarabanis <br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147177271400027X

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractElectronic participation (eParticipation) refers to the use of Information and Communication Technologies to enhance political participation and citizen engagement. During the last few years, eParticipation researchers have focused on analysing the field, investigating the main challenges, studying different initiatives, and proposing relevant evaluation criteria. However, current literature lacks comprehensive studies for understanding the factors influencing success when designing eParticipation initiatives. The main aim of this paper is to determine a concrete set of success factors to be considered when designing an eParticipation initiative. For this purpose, we review the literature on eGovernment success and on eParticipation success and evaluation, and we conduct a European-wide survey and desktop research amongst eParticipation practitioners. By comparing findings from the literature and the practitioners' research, we thereafter construct a proposed model of eParticipation success factors. The model includes 23 success factors and specific activities associated with each factor. We anticipate that our model will be useful to both eParticipation researchers and practitioners interested in the design of eParticipation initiatives.<br><h1>Adaptive capacity in light of Hurricane Sandy: The need for policy engagement</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Melissa Wagnera, , , Netra Chhetrib, Melanie Sturmc<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622814000101

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThe aftermath of Hurricane Sandy brings to light the tenuous U.S. model of natural disaster management. Climatic extremes, like Sandy, are projected to increase in magnitude and frequency, calling upon societies to adapt appropriately to imminent threats. In this paper, we describe the knowledge and policy disconnect exposed by Sandy between what we submit are four key elements of adaptive capacity: resources, institutions, knowledge and innovation of technology. Our synthesis of multi-disciplinary expert knowledge and admonition from civil engineers, climatologists, and urban planners demonstrates the significance of mobilizing knowledge to design robust socio-ecological systems. We contrast the U.S. model to the Dutch system of climate adaptation to emphasize the feasibility, value, and effectiveness of adopting robust adaptive capacities, rather than policies steeped in reactionary responses. Such strategies that integrate coordination and imagination from members across society are imperative in translating scientific foresight into institutional action. The solution we offer is not only material for a more action-based discussion, but also provides an illustration of crafting policy that enhances adaptive capacities of socio-ecological systems.<br><h1>Climate change scenarios and citizen-participation: Mitigation and adaptation perspectives in constructing sustainable futures</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Katarina Larsena, , , Ulrika Gunnarsson-Östlingb, <br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397508000672

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThis paper discusses adaptation and mitigation strategies as outlined in climate change scenarios. The adaptive perspective is closely connected to the concept of resilience understood as different views on nature's capacity to absorb shocks, renewal and re-organization. In constructing normative scenarios images of the future are generated illustrating potential ways of living, travelling and consuming products and services where certain goals such as a reduced climate impact are fulfilled. This paper argues that tension arising from climate strategies relying on either adaptation or mitigation strategies, or combining the two strategies, warrant further examination. In this paper the inter-relationships between adaptation and mitigation are discussed by examining processes of citizen-participation in constructing scenarios and applying the concepts of resilience, vulnerability and adaptive capacity. We discuss this using the concept of deliberative planning processes as a means to achieve legitimate, effective and sustainable futures. As a part of this approach, we argue that methods for citizen-participation applied in exploring different science and technology options also provide useful insight for this type of planning processes. The theoretical arguments are combined with examples from environmental scenario construction in practice. The paper brings attention to tensions between sustainability content values, such as reduced climate impact, and more process-oriented values such as legitimacy, learning and participatory scenario construction. Moreover, the concept of open innovation processes is introduced to the context of participatory scenario construction comparing shared ground in terms of user-involvement in search of novel solutions and also increasing robustness of action plans implemented to reduce climate change.<br><h1>Participation in flood risk management and the potential of citizen observatories: A governance analysis</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Uta Wehna, , , Maria Ruscaa, Jaap Eversa, Vitavesca Lanfranchib<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901114002457

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThe implementation of the European Flood Directive 2007/60/EC requires the establishment of public participation mechanisms to ensure citizens’ involvement in the flood management cycle. This raises questions on how to achieve this goal and successfully translate the directive into meaningful and effective participation. Innovative means, such as citizen observatories enabled by information and communication technologies, have the potential to provide citizens with a substantially new role in decision-making. In this paper, we present a framework developed for analysing the potential for participation via ICT-enabled citizen observatories and undertake a comparative analysis of the UK, the Netherlands and Italy. Expository and qualitative research was undertaken in the three case study areas, with the aim of identifying and comparing the transposition of the EU Flood directive and the mechanisms in place for citizens’ participation during different phases of the disaster cycle (prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery). Our analysis of the transposition of legal obligations for citizen participation shows that implementation is limited when examining both the respective roles and types of interactions between citizen and authorities and the impact of citizen participation on decision-making. Different authorities have differing perceptions of citizen participation in flood risk management in terms of their roles and influence. Our results also indicate that these perceptions are related to the importance that the authorities place on the different stages of the disaster cycle. This understanding is crucial for identifying the potential of citizen observatories to foster greater citizen engagement and participation.<br><h1>The National Space Biomedical Research Institute's education and public outreach program: Working toward a global 21st century space exploration society</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Marlene Y.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractSpace Exploration educators worldwide are confronting challenges and embracing opportunities to prepare students for the global 21st century workforce. The National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI), established in 1997 through a NASA competition, is a 12-university consortium dedicated to space life science research and education. NSBRI's Education and Public Outreach Program (EPOP) is advancing the Institute's mission by responding to global educational challenges through activities that: provide teacher professional development; develop curricula that teach students to communicate with their peers across the globe; provide women and minority US populations with greater access to, and awareness of science careers; and promote international science education partnerships.A recent National Research Council (NRC) Space Studies Board Report, America's Future in Space: Aligning the Civil Program with National Needs, acknowledges that “a capable workforce for the 21st century is a key strategic objective for the US space program… (and that) US problems requiring best efforts to understand and resolve…are global in nature and must be addressed through mutual worldwide action”. [1] This sentiment has gained new momentum through a recent National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) report, which recommends that the life of the International Space Station be extended beyond the planned 2016 termination. [2] The two principles of globalization and ISS utility have elevated NSBRI EPOP efforts to design and disseminate science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) educational materials that prepare students for full participation in a globalized, high technology society; promote and provide teacher professional development; create research opportunities for women and underserved populations; and build international educational partnerships.This paper describes select EPOP projects and makes the case for using innovative, emerging information technologies to transfer space exploration knowledge to students, engage educators from across the globe in discourse about science curricula, and foster multimedia collaborations that inform citizens about the benefits of space exploration for life on Earth. Special references are made to educational activities conducted at professional meetings in Austria, Canada, France, China, Greece, Italy, Russia, Scotland and Spain.<br><h1>Socializing in emergencies—A review of the use of social media in emergency situations</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Tomer Simona, b, , , Avishay Goldbergb, c, Bruria Adinia, b<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401215000638

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractSocial media tools are integrated in most parts of our daily lives, as citizens, netizens, researchers or emergency responders. Lessons learnt from disasters and emergencies that occurred globally in the last few years have shown that social media tools may serve as an integral and significant component of crisis response. Communication is one of the fundamental tools of emergency management. It becomes crucial when there are dozens of agencies and organizations responding to a disaster. Regardless of the type of emergency, whether a terrorist attack, a hurricane or an earthquake, communication lines may be overloaded and cellular networks overwhelmed as too many people attempt to use them to access information. Social scientists have presented that post-disaster active public participation was largely altruistic, including activities such as search and rescue, first aid treatment, victim evacuation, and on-line help. Social media provides opportunities for engaging citizens in the emergency management by both disseminating information to the public and accessing information from them. During emergency events, individuals are exposed to large quantities of information without being aware of their validity or risk of misinformation, but users are usually swift to correct them, thus making the social media “self-regulating”.<br><h1>The eBird enterprise: An integrated approach to development and application of citizen science</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Brian L.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractCitizen-science projects engage volunteers to gather or process data to address scientific questions. But citizen-science projects vary in their ability to contribute usefully for science, conservation, or public policy. eBird has evolved from a basic citizen-science project into a collective enterprise, taking a novel approach to citizen science by developing cooperative partnerships among experts in a wide range of fields: population and distributions, conservation biologists, quantitative ecologists, statisticians, computer scientists, GIS and informatics specialists, application developers, and data administrators. The goal is to increase data quantity through participant recruitment and engagement, but also to quantify and control for data quality issues such as observer variability, imperfect detection of species, and both spatial and temporal bias in data collection. Advances at the interface among ecology, statistics, and computer science allow us to create new species distribution models that provide accurate estimates across broad spatial and temporal scales with extremely detailed resolution. eBird data are openly available and used by a broad spectrum of students, teachers, scientists, NGOs, government agencies, land managers, and policy makers. Feedback from this broad data use community helps identify development priorities. As a result, eBird has become a major source of biodiversity data, increasing our knowledge of the dynamics of species distributions, and having a direct impact on the conservation of birds and their habitats.<br><h1>Participatory geographic information systems for agricultural water management scenario development: A Tanzanian case study â</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Steve Cinderbya, , , , Annemarieke de Bruina, , Boniface Mbilinyib, , Victor Kongoc, , Jennie Barrona, <br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474706511001550

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractOne of the keys to environmental management is to understand the impact and interaction of people with natural resources as a means to improve human welfare and the consequent environmental sustainability for future generations. In terms of water management one of the on-going challenges is to assess what impact interventions in agriculture, and in particularly different irrigation strategies, will have on livelihoods and water resources in the landscape.Whilst global and national policy provide the overall vision of desired outcomes for environmental management, agricultural development and water use strategies they are often presented with local challenges to embed these policies in the reality on the ground, with different stakeholder groups.The concept that government agencies, advocacy organizations, and private citizens should work together to identify mutually acceptable solutions to environmental and water resource issues is increasing in prominence. Participatory spatial engagement techniques linked to geographic information systems (commonly termed participatory GIS (PGIS)) offers one solution to facilitate such stakeholder dialogues in an efficient and consultative manner.In the context of agricultural water management multi-scale PGIS techniques have recently been piloted as part of the ‘Agricultural Water Management Solutions’ project to investigate the current use and dependencies of water by small-holder farmers a watershed in Tanzania. The piloted approach then developed PGIS scenarios describing the effects on livelihoods and water resources in the watershed when introducing different management technologies.These relatively rapid PGIS multi-scale methods show promise for assessing current and possible future agriculture water management technologies in terms of their bio-physical and socio-economic impacts at the watershed scale. The paper discusses the development of the methodology in the context of improved water management decision making.<br><h1>E-governance innovation: Barriers and strategies</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Albert Meijer, Author Vitae<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X15000192

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractVarious models have been developed to explain the adoption of e-government but systematic research on barriers to e-governance is lacking. On the basis of the literature, this paper develops a theoretical model of e-governance innovation that highlights (1) phases in the innovation process, (2) government and citizen barriers and (3) structural and cultural barriers. Fixing problems and framing stories are presented as the two principal strategies for tackling the various barriers throughout the innovation process. This model is explored in a case study of a technological system for collaboration between police and citizens in The Netherlands. The case shows the value of the model and highlights that e-governance innovation is about designing comprehensive strategies of fixing and framing to tackle the variety of barriers. More specifically, the research highlights that government officials and citizens are not motivated by the promise of technology but by frames that connect technological opportunities to the production of public value.<br><h1>Women and water management in times of climate change: participatory and inclusive processes</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Patricia Figueiredo , Patricia E.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThis paper focuses on community engagement, and particularly the inclusion of women, in water management as a response to climate change. Addressing water-related problems is central to climate change adaptation, and civil society, marginalized populations and women, in particular, must be involved. This is for both moral and pragmatic reasons: not only are the marginalized the first and worst affected by extreme weather events, but they also possess local ecological, social and political knowledge which can inform and contribute significantly to climate change adaptation strategies. Because of their social roles and position worldwide, women are greatly affected by water scarcity and flooding, and tend to be gravely impacted by poor water management, yet they face great difficulties in participating effectively in governance bodies. Sustainable long-term management of water resources in the face of climate change requires the participation of women, who possess knowledge of effective social technologies for coping with and adapting to climate change. Community-based environmental education is therefore required in order to expand the equitable involvement of women in water-related climate change adaptation activities and policy development. Environmental non-governmental organizations worldwide, working on shoestring budgets at the local level, are developing a range of methods to organize, raise consciousness and confidence, and help local activists create successful climate defense programs. This paper discusses South–North initiatives and models for community-based environmental and climate change education which are using the democratic opening provided by watershed-based governance structures to broaden grassroots participation, especially of women, in political processes. We outline the activities and results of two international projects: the Sister Watersheds project, with Brazilian and Canadian partners (2002–2008); and a Climate Change Adaptation in Africa project with partners in Canada, Kenya, Mozambique, and South Africa (2010–2012).<br><h1>Building social connectedness in schools: Australian teachers’ perspectives</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>J.M.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThis paper presents the findings of Phase 1 of a larger study examining social connectedness in schools.A semi-structured interview was conducted with 14 teachers to ascertain perceptions of social connectedness across three high schools in a city in Queensland, Australia. The interview examined how teachers perceived four broad strategy levels for building social connectedness: (i) at a school level; (ii) linking to the broader community; (iii) at a classroom level; and (iv) helping individuals to connect.All schools employed school-wide practices to involve the community in the education process, recognizing the importance of cultural and background knowledge, civic participation, and school–community interactions. The three areas identified to improve connectedness within the school communities were to recognize and embrace the important role of technology for community building, to allow time within the curriculum for teachers to work on the social and emotional well-being of their students, and to reinforce efforts to develop a shared language for staff around pedagogical practices.Teachers gave strong support to the need for ongoing professional learning, peer collaboration, and administrative support, and sufficient quality time to achieve these outcomes.<br><h1>Foresight tools for participative policy-making in inter-governmental processes in developing countries: Lessons learned from the eLAC Policy Priorities Delphi</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Martin Hilberta, , , Author Vitae, Ian MilesbAuthor Vitae, Julia OthmercAuthor Vitae<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162509000031

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThe paper shows how international foresight exercises, through online and offline tools, can make policy-making in developing countries more participatory, fostering transparency and accountability of public decision-making. A five-round Delphi exercise (with 1454 contributions), based on the priorities of the 2005–2007 Latin American and Caribbean Action Plan for the Information Society (eLAC2007), was implemented. This exercise aimed at identifying future priorities that offered input into the inter-governmental negotiation of a 2008–2010 Action Plan (eLAC2010). It is believed to be the most extensive online participatory policy-making foresight exercise in the history of intergovernmental processes in the developing world to date. In addition to the specific policy guidance provided, the major lessons learned include (1) the potential of Policy Delphi methods to introduce transparency and accountability into public decision-making, especially in developing countries; (2) the utility of foresight exercises to foster multi-agency networking in the development community; (3) the usefulness of embedding foresight exercises into established mechanisms of representative democracy and international multilateralism, such as the United Nations; (4) the potential of online tools to facilitate participation in resource-scarce developing countries; and (5) the resource-efficiency stemming from the scale of international foresight exercises, and therefore its adequacy for resource-scarce regions. Two different types of practical implications have been observed. One is the governments' acknowledgement of the value of collective intelligence from civil society, academic and private sector participants of the Delphi and the ensuing appreciation of participative policy-making. The other is the demonstration of the role that can be played by the United Nations (and potentially by other inter-governmental agencies) in international participatory policy-making in the digital age, especially if they modernize the way they assist member countries in developing public policy agendas.<br><h1>Patienten- und Bürgerpartizipation in der Entscheidungsfindung im Gesundheitswesen insbesondere bei der Bewertung von Arzneimitteln</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Axel C.

Es gibt einen allgemeinen Konsens über die Notwendigkeit für eine stärkere Patientenzentrierung, insbesondere in HTA-Prozessen. Im internationalen Vergleich werden dazu verschiedene Möglichkeiten der Beteiligung der Öffentlichkeit (Bürger, Versicherte und Patienten) in den Entscheidungsprozessen diskutiert und getestet.Das Ziel dieses Übersichtsartikels besteht darin, die internationalen Erfahrungen und Möglichkeiten in der Patienten- und Bürgerbeteiligung zu erfassen und darzustellen. Dabei können in Bezug auf Gesundheitstechnologien verschiedene Ebenen der Entscheidungsfindung unterschieden werden: Zulassung, Erstattungsfähigkeit, Preisfestsetzung und schließlich Inanspruchnahme der Technologien.Die Spannbreite der Partizipationsbemühungen erstreckt sich über die qualitative Erhebung von Patientenbedürfnissen (Citizen Councils des NICE) bis hin zur wissenschaftlich fundierten Dokumentation quantitativer Patientenpräferenzen, wie beispielsweise in den aktuellen Pilotprojekten der FDA in den USA und der EMA auf europäischer Ebene.Mögliche Ansätze zur Erfassung und Dokumentation von Präferenzstrukturen und den Abwägungsprozessen in Bezug auf Gesundheitstechnologien bieten Entscheidungshilfen, wie die multikriterielle Entscheidungsanalyse (MCDA), die notwendigen Informationen zur Gewichtung und Priorisierung der Entscheidungskriterien liefern.<br><h1>Social media as a catalyst for online deliberation?

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThis manuscript aims to assess the potential of social media as a channel to foster democratic deliberation. It does this by examining whether the types of discussions that citizens maintain in two of the most used social media channels managed by the White House – Facebook and YouTube – meet the necessary conditions for deliberative democracy. For this purpose 7230 messages were analyzed and assessed in terms of indicators developed to evaluate online discourse derived from the work of Habermas. By contrasting social media channels that differ in the affordances of identifiability and networked information access (two traditional predictors of online deliberation), we seek to contribute a deeper understanding of social media and its impact on deliberation. Drawing on the social identification/deindividuation (SIDE) model of computer mediated communication and network theories, we predict that political discussions in Facebook will present a more egalitarian distribution of comments between discussants and higher level of politeness in their messages. Consistent with our theoretical framework, results confirm that Facebook expands the flow of information to other networks and enables more symmetrical conversations among users, whereas politeness is lower in the more anonymous and deindividuated YouTube.<br><h1>Social media in Saudi Arabia: Exploring its use during two natural disasters</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Yeslam Al-Saggafa, , , Author Vitae, Peter SimmonsbAuthor Vitae<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162514002522

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThe study explored social media activity during two peacetime natural disasters in Saudi Arabia, a country where citizen participation in public matters is minimized and communication with government is characterised by restraint. A qualitative thematic analysis using concepts from public sphere, online public sphere and previous studies of social media was used with 5000 threads taken from YouTube, Facebook, Al-Saha Al-Siyasia and Al Arabiya. Social media helped users to communicate the gravity of the damage of the floods; discuss rationally what really happened, and why and who was responsible; criticize the government and call for action to be taken to remedy the situation; and express deep emotions of sadness over the loss of lives in a way that united people. Rational discussion was evident on Facebook and Al-Saha Al-Siyasia, but social media was more useful for reading the emotional state of the people than as a vehicle for communicating the deliberative and rational aspirations of the public sphere. Social media is unlikely to produce social change on its own, but is likely to facilitate social and political trends for change already occurring in countries, and this may be accelerated during times of disaster when heightened emotions embolden people. Governments may regard social media as a vehicle for undesirable pressure, or positively as a window on the emotional state of their people that helps them to respond more appropriately.<br><h1>Dimensions and determinants of expert and public attitudes to sustainable transport policies and technologies</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Dimitrios Xenias, , , Lorraine Whitmarsh<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856412001462

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThis paper investigates (a) attitudes to sustainable transport and how these differ between experts and non-experts, and (b) factors that influence these attitudes and their relevant importance in explaining why such differences occur. Attitudes of experts (N = 53) and British public (N = 40) were compared using open-ended questionnaires, attitude scales, analytic hierarchy process and preference ranking. Both samples prioritised reduction in transport demand in qualitative measures. In quantitative measures, however, experts preferred techno-economic measures while the public prioritised behaviour change and public transport improvement. Some options for sustainable transport also varied with individuals’ values, suggesting that expertise alone does not fully account for variation in attitudes. Different perspectives and values imply a need for a broader definition of expertise in transport policy-making, and that the public may not accept transport policies/technologies designed by experts – underlining the importance of early public engagement.<br><h1>An Analysis Of How The Participatory Culture Through The Internet Is Fostered In Policies Directed Towards Non-Formal Educational Contexts</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Margarita Silvestra Leóna, , , José Miguel Correab, Jesús María Aramberria, Estibaliz Jiménez de Aberasturib<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187704281102489X

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractMauritius, a country that represents one of the leading advocates of e-Governance in Sub-Saharan Africa, has taken significant action to improve e-readiness dimensions and as such ranks high in terms of e-readiness index with respect to other Sub-Saharan African countries, based on the United Nations Global e-Government Readiness index. A close look at the usage rate of e-Government services such as online application, however, reveals that it is very low while online transaction is still rhetoric. This paper therefore assesses whether the high e-readiness index gives a true indication of the citizens' e-readiness using available secondary data sources. It further explores the factors facilitating and inhibiting citizens' e-readiness through the administration of a survey questionnaire. The main findings reveal that the barriers inhibiting citizens' e-readiness are resistance to change, absence of opportunities for e-participation and e-consultation, and lack of awareness. The main facilitators of citizens' e-readiness emanating from the analysis are awareness campaigns which tease out the advantages of online public services compared to traditional methods of service delivery, building of trust in government, and managing change.<br><h1>The impact of electronic land administration on urban housing development: The case study of the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Adewale Akingbade, Diego Navarra, Jaap Zevenbergen, Yola Georgiadou<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397511000828

It analyses conceptually the differences between the expected and actual value of Abuja Geographic Information Systems (AGIS)—an e-land administration project—on urbanisation in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) of Nigeria. The AGIS case study reveals that differences between the expected and actual value of strengthening the state’s financial capacity are low. The differences are medium for enhancing access to and security of credit, and improvement of land use planning and environmental management and high for the promotion of popular participation. The elicited differences are traceable to hindrances inscribed in Land Use and National Housing Acts, to inequitable access to land, inconsistent resettlement policy, poor community participation and financial misconduct. The findings suggest the need to pay attention to provisions through which e-government can support the reduction of country specific problems, improve the quality of institutions and to promote urbanisation, thereby increasing social welfare as well as participation by the people in promoting suitable and adequate shelter for all citizens.<br><h1>FuturICT: FET Flagship Pilot Project</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Steven Bishopa, , Dirk Helbingb, Paul Lukowiczc, Rosaria Conted<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187705091100679X

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThe ultimate goal of the FuturICT Flagship is to understand and manage complex, global, socially interactive systems, with a focus on sustainability and resilience. Revealing the hidden laws and processes underlying societies constitutes the most pressing scientific grand challenge of our century. Integrating the three components of ICT, Complexity Science and the Social Sciences will lead to a paradigm shift, facilitating a symbiotic co-evolution of ICT and society. Data from our complex globe-spanning ICT system will be leveraged to develop models of techno-socio-economic systems. In turn, insight from these models will inform the development of a new generation of socially adaptive, self-organised ICT systems.FuturICT as a whole will act as a Knowledge Accelerator, turning massive data into knowledge and technological progress. FuturICT will create the scientific methods and ICT platforms needed to address planetary-scale challenges and opportunities in the 21st century. Specifically, FuturICT will build a sophisticated simulation, visualization and participation platform, known as the Living Earth Simulator. This platform will power Observatories, to detect and mitigate crises, and Participatory Platforms, to support decision-making for policy-makers and citizens.In the Coordination Action Pilot Study which is running from May 2011-April 2012, activities will take place to develop the scientific vision and roadmap, secure stakeholder commitment, establish the FuturICT legal and operational infrastructure, and build on our remarkable success in uniting previously fragmented research communities. The main aim of the activities throughout the project will be to refine the FuturICT vision and identify measureable milestones along the way. This will produce an ambitious large-scale, science-driven, visionary research initiative to promote and develop future research outcomes in ICT. Through these activities, the Coordination Action will allow Europe to grasp this unique opportunity for groundbreaking progress in science and ICT, with great impacts for society, governance and industry by launching the FuturICT Flagship in 2013.<br><h1>Technological options for the removal of arsenic with special reference to South East Asia</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>C.K.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractArsenic contamination in ground water, used for drinking purpose, has been envisaged as a problem of global concern. However, arsenic contamination of ground water in parts of South East Asia is assuming greater proportions and posing a serious threat to the health of millions of people. A variety of treatment technologies based on oxidation, co-precipitation, adsorption, ion exchange and membrane process are available for the removal of arsenic from ground water. However, question remains regarding the efficiency and applicability/appropriateness of the technologies, particularly because of low influent arsenic concentration and differences in source water composition. Some of these methods are quite simple, but the disadvantage associated with them is that they produce large amounts of toxic sludge, which needs further treatment before disposal into the environment. Besides, the system must be economically viable and socially acceptable. In this paper an attempt has been made to review and update the recent advances made in the technological development in arsenic removal technologies to explore the potential of those advances to address the problem of arsenic contamination in South East Asia.<br><h1>Securization of policy making social computing.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractPolicy making social computing conform a set of social software tools that deal with the e-participation of citizens in policy making, that is to say, with the conjoint (representatives and citizens) design and selection through the internet of public policies. E-cognocracy is a cognitive democracy oriented to the extraction and sharing of knowledge associated with the scientific resolution of public decision making problems related with the governance of society. This model of democracy takes advantage of the potential of the Knowledge Society with the incorporation of the knowledge and the preferences of the actors involved in the decision making process. This uses different rounds in order to incorporate the preferences through an e-voting module and the arguments that support the individual positions through e-discussion. Considering e-cognocracy as the democracy model that supports interaction between citizens and their representatives in the construction of a better world, this paper presents a new proposal for the technological securization of the e-voting (prioritization) and e-discussion stages of e-cognocracy. This new suggestion, in which the electoral authority has been eliminated through the use of short linkable ring signatures, is a more simple and efficient system than our previous proposals.<br><h1>Enabling development through governance and mobile technology</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Adegboyega Ojoa, , Author Vitae, Tomasz Janowskia, Author Vitae, Johanna Awotwib, Author Vitae<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X12001505

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThe impact of mobile technology on governance and development has attracted significant interest in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for Development and Electronic Governance communities. There is growing consensus that governance mechanisms must complement access to technology to achieve greater impact on development. However, few or no rigorous research exists to show how such mechanisms can support the delivery of mobile services to vulnerable groups. This study fills this important gap by first providing a conceptual framework, based on the Choice Framework and the Structuration Theory, to elaborate on the relationship between ICT, governance and citizen capabilities. Second, the framework is applied to analyze livelihood needs of 45 women head porters interviewed in Accra. Third, as all women under study have access to mobile phones, we determine which governance mechanisms are needed to support the delivery of mobile services to them. Results show that three governance mechanisms enable the contribution of mobile technology to meeting the livelihood needs of this group: 1) updating financial and telecommunication regulations to enable the provision of mobile-based services e.g. mobile microfinance, to vulnerable groups; 2) mobilizing local communities in the production of local contents; and 3) engaging non-governmental organizations in building capacity of government agencies in mobile service delivery and in training vulnerable communities in effective use of mobile technology to access information and services critical to their needs. We conclude by discussing the use of the Structuration Theory along with the Choice Framework to shape development processes based on citizen needs and by discussing the applicability of our framework to similar vulnerable groups.<br><h1>Climate Change and Infrastructure Impacts: Comparing the Impact on Roads in ten Countries through 2100 â</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Amy Schweikert, , Paul Chinowsky, Xavier Espinet, Michael Tarbert<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705814010595

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractClimate change poses a critical threat to future development, particularly in areas where poverty is widespread and key assets such as infrastructure are underdeveloped for even current needs. The focus of this study includes ten geographically and economically diverse countries and the impact of 54 distinct AR4 Global Circulation Model (GCM) scenarios of future climate change on their existing road networks. The analysis is completed using a software tool which uses engineering and materials-based stressor-response functions to determine the impact of climate on maintenance, repair and construction. This study represents an update to a previous study conducted by the authors in 2011. The key updates include methodological advances, policy-oriented results presentation and the use of a new software tool developed by the authors.For nine out of ten countries in the study, pro-active adaptation measures result in lower fiscal costs and higher connectivity rates as early as 2025. The results through 2100 are presented and the costs of climate change present clear findings for these countries in terms of road maintenance, construction, and adaptation policy.In rural areas, particularly those in low-income countries, roads represent a lifeline for economic and agricultural livelihood, as well as a number of indirect benefits including access to healthcare, education, credit, political participation, and more. Roads may be sparse through geographic locations, making each road critical. Extreme events pose a costly hazard to roads in terms of degradation, necessary maintenance, and potential decrease in lifespan due to climatic impacts.Climate change poses costly impacts in terms of maintenance, repairs and lost connectivity; yet many of these impacts can be mitigated and avoided by pro-active adaptation measures. It is a crucial consideration for protecting current and future infrastructure investments and the economic, social, and other functions they serve.The Infrastructure Planning Support System (IPSS) is a software tool designed to quantify the impacts of both extreme events and incremental climatic changes on road infrastructure in any geographic location throughout the world. The system identifies the financial cost on a yearly basis through 2100 and allows users to compare proactive adaptation measures and reactive non-adaptation measures. IPSS compares a ‘no climate change’ scenario as a baseline to provide information on the ‘regret’ that may occur if a predicted outcome of climate change model does not manifest as projected. Infrastructure impacts are determined based on civil engineering materials research, field studies of actual impacts on roads and buildings, and additional data. These resources are combined into stressor-response equations which are implemented to provide specific cost estimates. Additionally, the program can be customized to a specific location where data is available on stressor-response impacts on the infrastructure elements being analyzed.This paper focuses on the methodology and application of the IPSS tool to countries representing a range of incomes including low-income, middle, and upper income countries. The IPSS tool is used to compare costs of adaptation and opportunity cost for each country. The results indicate that higher income countries face significant dollar costs due to the extensive road networks, with very high costs in Japan and Italy, in particular. Bolivia, Ethiopia, and Cameroon all show extremely high advantages to adaptation, yet the costs required to simply maintain existing networks are equivalent to funding equal to doubling or tripling the existing paved road inventory. These results can help policy makers at the national and international levels decide where and how to invest; and show that climate change represents a significant and urgent threat to transportation throughout the world.<br><h1>Technology in government: How organizational culture mediates information and communication technology outcomes</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Eric W.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThe adoption of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in public organizations promises to better connect managers with citizens, increase public participation in government decision making, improve the efficiency of service delivery, decrease uncertainty, and improve information dissemination. While each of these outcomes is important for both public managers and citizens, we know little about how organizational culture mediates the effectiveness of ICTs on producing these outcomes. This research, using data from two points in time, investigates the relationships between ICTs and managerial outcomes (e.g. improved decision making and public participation) and how they are mediated by organizational culture such as centralization and routineness. Technology variables include technology use and capacity. Models will control for other organizational and technological factors such as size, structure, task and department to investigate the mediating effects of organizational culture on ICT outcomes for local governments. The data come from two national surveys of 2500 local government managers in the United States in 2010 and 2012. The results are important for understanding how organizational mechanisms, in particular organization culture, mobilize ICTs in ways that affect managerial outcomes.<br><h1>Spaceship Earth.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractAs awareness towards the problem is growing, eco-friendliness is today a paramount requirement for all space activities and in particular for the ground segment, fully comparable to other industrial sectors. The present work focuses on the assessment and the sustainable development enhancement of a ground-based space facility, the European Astronaut Centre (EAC), located in Germany. The project is framed within the European Space Agency development of an environmental outlook, which aims not only at the full compliance with the legislation and at assessing the impact of its activities, but also at laying the foundation for future evolution through innovation. Indeed, ESA promotes the sustainable use of space as a necessity and duty for Europe. As history teaches us, technical knowledge emerged within the space sector serves as innovation driver in other industrial branches: the goal of the project is to transform the EAC building into a spaceship integrated with the territory through the conscious management of this spontaneous process, fostering the combination between the space sector and the architecture and civil engineering fields. The work explores the potential of space technologies, processes and systems applied on ground and presents a range of space-driven innovative concepts which may improve the sustainability of the EAC building, focusing on different aspects of its resource demand – energy, water and waste management – and defining the integration with the pre-existing compound, the limitation of the impact on the surrounding landscape and the participation of the local community as additional fundamental requirements. Indeed, the project embraces the full concept of sustainability, which considers not only eco-friendliness but also its balance with economic and social aspects. Two factors – a certain urgency for action, which leaves little space for research and experimentation, and a call for ground-breaking solutions – guided the design activity: taking advantage of these conflicting requirements, a comparison between standard technologies and innovative space-related concepts was performed. When dealing with complex and uncertain scenarios, decision among the possible solutions is not straightforward and needs to be supported by appropriate methodologies: a multi-criteria and quantitative decision-making tool, able to concentrate on the main goal while considering all other relevant aspects – environmental, economic, social sustainability – was therefore developed. Furthermore, the project promotes local community participation in the decisional process, as a way to enhance knowledge, generate understanding and promote towards the EAC redesign, space activities and their potential innovative impact on sustainability.<br><h1>Designing Pay-As-You-Throw schemes in municipal waste management services: A holistic approach</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Valerio Elia, Maria Grazia Gnoni, , Fabiana Tornese<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X15300568

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractPay-As-You-Throw (PAYT) strategies are becoming widely applied in solid waste management systems; the main purpose is to support a more sustainable – from economic, environmental and social points of view – management of waste flows. Adopting PAYT charging models increases the complexity level of the waste management service as new organizational issues have to be evaluated compared to flat charging models. In addition, innovative technological solutions could also be adopted to increase the overall efficiency of the service. Unit pricing, user identification and waste measurement represent the three most important processes to be defined in a PAYT system. The paper proposes a holistic framework to support an effective design and management process. The framework defines most critical processes and effective organizational and technological solutions for supporting waste managers as well as researchers.<br><h1>Methods of legitimation: How ethics committees decide which reasons count in public policy decision-making</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Kyle T.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractIn recent years, liberal democratic societies have struggled with the question of how best to balance expertise and democratic participation in the regulation of emerging technologies. This study aims to explain how national deliberative ethics committees handle the practical tension between scientific expertise, ethical expertise, expert patient input, and lay public input by explaining two institutions' processes for determining the legitimacy or illegitimacy of reasons in public policy decision-making: that of the United Kingdom's Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) and the United States' American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM). The articulation of these ‘methods of legitimation’ draws on 13 in-depth interviews with HFEA and ASRM members and staff conducted in January and February 2012 in London and over Skype, as well as observation of an HFEA deliberation. This study finds that these two institutions employ different methods in rendering certain arguments legitimate and others illegitimate: while the HFEA attempts to ‘balance’ competing reasons but ultimately legitimizes arguments based on health and welfare concerns, the ASRM seeks to ‘filter’ out arguments that challenge reproductive autonomy. The notably different structures and missions of each institution may explain these divergent approaches, as may what Sheila Jasanoff (2005) terms the distinctive ‘civic epistemologies’ of the US and the UK. Significantly for policy makers designing such deliberative committees, each method differs substantially from that explicitly or implicitly endorsed by the institution.<br><h1>Reprint of: When peer-reviewed publications are not enough!

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractOver the last century, natural resource management on forest lands has shifted from a singular focus on resource extraction to many foci, such as recreation, tourism, conservation, view-scapes, cultural and spiritual values, sustainability, and other values. As a result, the information needs of land managers must now include social and cultural values. In addition, the public's interest in having greater participation in land management decisions and in generating scientific knowledge has never been greater. The generation of scientific knowledge which is expressed primarily through conventional means – such as peer-reviewed publications targeting academics and technology transfer (e.g., patents, licenses, agreements) primarily for government and industry – does not always satisfy the needs of resource managers and public. In recent decades, there has been rapid growth of methods to help bridge this gap by better connecting new knowledge and knowledge generation with public needs. The U.S. Forest Service is making science delivery as important goal as science creation, including structural institutional changes at the interface among researchers, resource managers, and the public, allocating an appropriate portion of project funding specifically for delivery. The Forest Service is considering increasing its use of citizen science and participatory research – which brings resource managers, decision makers, and the public into the research process to varying extents – as part of the agency's science delivery efforts. Here we explore citizen science and participatory research as possible vehicles to augment existing science delivery efforts from the perspective of a federal land management agency. We found that these mechanisms facilitate public involvement in fundamentally different ways. Depending on the type of research and desired use of research outcomes, either citizen science or participatory research could enhance the use of science in some natural resource management discussions, possibly leading to supportable solutions.<br><h1>Of solar collectors, wind power, and car sharing: Comparing and understanding successful cases of grassroots innovations</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Michael Ornetzedera, , , , , Harald Rohracherb, 1, , <br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378012001471

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractGrassroots activities so far have not been sufficiently appreciated as sources of innovation. Transition processes towards more sustainable socio-technical energy, transport or production systems, however, are hardly imaginable without a broader participation of engaged citizens. This paper presents and compares three cases of successful grassroots innovations for sustainability. In particular we compare the development of wind technology in Denmark, the solar collector do-it-yourself movement in Austria, and the development of car sharing in Switzerland. The paper aims at a better understanding of the preconditions, patterns of growth and change and factors of success of grassroots innovations for more sustainable socio-technical regimes such as energy and transport. In the analysis we focus on dimensions such as the structural conditions and resources of origin, motivations of social actors involved, learning processes and outcomes, competences and activities of those actors, processes of institution-building, and the relationships to mainstream market actors. Based on the empirical background the paper discusses implications for the theorisation of grassroots innovations for greater sustainability and draws implications for further research.<br><h1>The political filter in the local implementation of initiatives relating to urban ecology</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Ian Douglas, , <br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204614000395

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractAny given national policy relating to nature in cities will be implemented in varying ways at the local level due to political will and local decision-makers’ perceptions of environmental and ecological priorities. Individual mayors, council leaders and powerful municipal officers can exert a major influence on a city's role in environmental matters. However, changes in policy at the national level can abruptly cause programmes to slow down, loose impetus or fail. In the UK, municipal responses to Local Agenda 21 after 1992 depended on whether or not councils were fully committed. As new national priorities emerged, the broad cross-sectoral participation in Local Agenda 21 was lost. New strategies had less outreach to the community. The UK Eco-town programme looked to be ambitious when it was announced, but financial constraints and political changes have led it to become a small scale Eco-community programme of more energy-efficient housing but with few of the originally broad ecological and sustainability goals. Good ideas for urban greenspace have to be fitted into the local political context.<br><h1>Urban Civil Structures Effect in the Development of Governance Concept in Developing Countries: The Case of City Councils in Turkey â</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Berkan Demiral <br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042814044723

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractGovernance is one of the main approaches of New Public Management (NPM) (Meuleman: 2008, Landman and Robinson: 2009) and it is an important concept for Turkey as it affects the entire private and the public sector. Expressing the participated governing process, its field of application includes non-governmental organizations and civil communities, central government and local governments. The emergence of more flexible decentralized and entrepreniuneal urban politics have been interpreted as an important part of transition from government to governance in economic and political context in Turkey like the other countries (Stoker: 1996, Ward: 2000, Jones: 1998, Oatley 1998, Whitehead: 2003). The mutual interaction with governance, the change in urban politics in Turkey has affected the new restructuring in local governments in large scale. This interaction is inevitable at a time of local and central government concept is eroding, the concepts of citizenship and participation are changing and urban economic development is restructured and globalized (Mac Leod and Goodwin: 1999, Stoker: 1996, Whitehead: 2003). The City Councils concept has appeared with Agenda-21 accepted after the Rio Summit. The City Councils in Turkey is an outcome of Local Agenda21 and established as an implementation of it. The main aims of them are to solve the problems that the cities are faced with, which affect the urban sustainability resulting from the city governments. The City Councils are established interdependently from the local governments in Turkey. Nonetheless they have made solutions for all the problems in the city as a civil initiative. But local governments, municipalities and private provincial administration have not notified them. The City Councils in Turkey gained legal status in 2005 after the admission of Municipality Act numbered 5393 in which there are regulations for them like in the article 76. In order to evaluate the city councils in Turkey two concepts, which are “governance” and “Local Agenda-21”, should be demystified. It is known that, city councils are suggested as a new participatory model based on governance in local. But the governance concept shouldn’t be seen only as a part of establishing new participatory models in cities but also, it's a key concept to establish a new government and social system as an instrument of New Public Management. In this study, it is argued if the City Councils implementations are transformed into governance based implementation and results of these implementations will be evaluated in terms of local governments and non-governmental organizations. Also, the structure, implementations and decisions of striking city councils in Turkey will be examined and the barriers in local governance will be discussed.<br><h1>When peer-reviewed publications are not enough!

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThis paper presents a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based optimization model for repetitive projects when considering soft logics. There have been several models developed for Times-Cost Trade-Off optimization in repetitive projects and these models were set up to search for optimum output rate that yields the minimum total cost for each project. Previous researches are based on the assumption that work sequence cannot be changed for different work zones. In reality, work sequence between work zones are not fixed (actually, constantly adjusted) throughout the project. Instead, they are constantly changed to shorten the construction time and minimize the total cost. Scheduling with the non-fixed work sequences between work zones is known as the soft logic method. Considering the soft logic in repetitive projects, the proposed GA model aims to assist the project team to find the minimum overall cost subjecting to different output rates and logical sequences.Taiwan has become an aging society. The aged participants can gain physical and mental health and happiness from recreational sports. Therefore, it is important to encourage the senior citizens to engage in recreational sports. The research purpose is to investigate influential factors and relative weights of personal preference and external environment application with a hybrid MCDM (multiple criteria decision making) model combining DEMATEL (decision making trial and evaluation laboratory) with ANP (analytical network process) methods. This study aims to demonstrate how the application of the MCDM model can improve participation and find important factors that can enhance sports and leisure participation. It also chooses the best leisure sports and enhances the experiences of people involved in the coming years. With the determinate results, the dimension of “external environment” is the most important aspect to be improved. In the seven evaluated criteria, “psychology” and “entertainment” are the most important considerations of the recreational sports program to be planned, followed by physical condition. Among the recreational sports types in the dimension of senior citizens’ selection, the best is “fitness sports” which will enhance the recreational sports participation, followed by “recreational sports”, “competition sports”, and “family sports”.<br><h1>Fostering the 21st Century Skills through Scientific Literacy and Science Process Skills</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Punia Turiman, Jizah Omar, Adzliana Mohd Daud, Kamisah Osman, <br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042812036944

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractTo overcome the challenges of the twenty first century in science and technology sector, students need to be equipped with the 21st century skills to ensure their competitiveness in the globalization era. They are expected to master the 21st century skills apart of just being excelled in their academic performance. Therefore, it is crucial to incorporate 21st century skills in science education. 21st century skills comprised of four main domains namely digital age literacy, inventive thinking, effective communication and high productivity. Scientific literacy is one of the skills required in digital age literacy. It means knowledge and understanding of the scientific concepts and processes required for personal decision-making, participation in civic and cultural affairs, and economic productivity. Scientific literacy is important in our modern society since they are many issues related to science and technology. Basic science process skills include observing, classifying, measuring and using numbers, making inferences, predicting, communicating and using the relations of space and time. While the integrated science process skills consist of interpreting data, operational definition, control variables, make hypotheses and experimenting. Science students have been cultivated by scientific literacy and science process skills through science classes. With these two skills, it is hoped that the science students have developed some skills needed in 21st century skills. This paper will further explain about the 21st century skills, scientific literacy and science process skills. It also explains about the intersection of science process skills and 21st century skills in science education.<br><h1>Loyal to your city?

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractCustomer loyalty programs are largely present in the private sector and have been elaborately studied. Applications from the private sector have found resonance in a public setting, however, simply extrapolating research results is not acceptable, as their rationale inherently differs. This study focuses on data from a loyalty program issued by the city of Antwerp (Belgium). The aim of the loyalty card entails large citizen participation, however, an active user base of only 20 % is reached. Predictive techniques are employed to increase this number. Using spatial behavioral user information, a Naive Bayes classifier and a Support Vector Machine are used which result in models capable of predicting whether a user will actively use its card, whether a user will defect in the near future and which locations a user will visit. Also, a projection of spatial behavioral data onto even more fine-grained spatio-temporal data is performed. The results are promising: the best model achieves an AUC value of 92.5 %, 85.5 % and 88.12 % (averaged over five locations) for the predictions, respectively. Moreover, as behavior is modeled in more detail, better predictions are made. Two main contributions are made in this study. First, as a theoretical contribution, fine-grained behavioral data contributes to a more sound decision-making process. Second, as a practical contribution, the city of Antwerp can now make tailored strategic decisions to increase its active user base.<br><h1>eParticipation research: Moving characterization forward (2006–2011)</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Rony Medaglia Author Vitae<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X12000378

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractResearch on the use of information technology to support democratic decision-making (eParticipation) is experiencing ongoing growth, stimulated by an increasing attention from both practitioner and research communities. This study provides the first longitudinal analysis of the development of the eParticipation field based on a shared framework, capturing the directions that the research field of eParticipation is taking in recent developments.Drawing on a literature search covering the period from April 2006 to March 2011, this study identifies, analyzes, and classifies 122 research articles within the categories of eParticipation actors, activities, contextual factors, effects, evaluation, and methods.Findings show that the field has a high level of dynamism, as foci on eParticipation activities, contextual factors, and effects have shifted in time, sometimes in counterintuitive directions. The study also suggests new analytical categories of research. Drawing on the analysis, inputs for a research agenda are suggested. These include the need to move beyond a technological perspective, encouraging the ongoing shift of research focus from government to citizens and other stakeholders, and the need to make eParticipation research methods more participatory in nature.<br><h1>Effects of structured inquiry and graphic organizers on social studies comprehension by students with autism spectrum disorders â</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Heather Schenninga, Victoria Knightb, , , Fred Spoonerc<br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1750946712001651

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractIn social studies, students learn about society and the culture in which they live, current and historical events, people from different backgrounds, and how to develop skills for participating in a democratic system. As people with disabilities are members of our society, participation in social studies content is an important component of their knowledge. Despite the potential benefits of learning social studies content, there is limited investigation in this area for individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In this study, three middle school students with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) who participated in alternate assessment standards testing based on alternate achievement standards (AA-AAS) learned social studies content (geographic relationships, historical perspectives, economics and development, and government and active citizenship) via structured inquiry and explicit instruction. Results from the single-case multiple probe across participants design suggest a functional relation between the implementation of structured inquiry using explicit instruction and student comprehension of social studies content. In addition, students were able to generalize to “real-world” applications. Future research and implications for practices are discussed.<br><h1>Designing social games for children and older adults: Two related case studies</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>Abdullah Al Mahmuda, , Omar Mubina, , , Suleman Shahidb, , Jean-Bernard Martensa, <br><b>Fuente: </b>Elsevier<br><b>URL: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875952110000066

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractAugmented games, aim at promoting social interaction between participating players, as this is considered a major characteristic of any good multi-player game. In this paper, we discuss two related case studies where we investigated various options for enhancing the gaming experience through augmented tabletop games for children and older adults. Later on we also executed an intergenerational case study to inform intergenerational game design where children and elderly played together. Our findings indicate that the use of tangible play in combination with a guessing element in a tabletop game does indeed facilitate social interaction and adds to the aspect of fun. Our results also indicate that senior citizens found the electronic tabletop version of the game to be more immersive and absorbing, as compared to a static paper version. Analyzing the non-verbal behavior of both older adults and children, it was concluded that players were socially more engaged with their opponents than with their team members. This effect was more pronounced in the case of children. We also discuss some implications for social game design that can be deduced from the qualitative feedback provided by our participants.<br><h1>Evaluation of the Q-method as a method of public participation in the selection of sustainable development indicators</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>D.G.

</a><br><b>Abstract: </b>AbstractThe complexity of sustainable development means that it is often difficult to evaluate and communicate the concept effectively. One standard method to reduce complexity and improve communication, while maintaining scientific objectivity, is to use selected indicators. The aim of this paper is to describe and evaluate a process of public participation in the selection of sustainable development indicators that utilised the Q-method for discourse analysis. The Q-method was utilised to combine public opinion with technical expertise to create a list of technically robust indicators that would be relevant to the public. The method comprises statement collection, statement analysis, Q-sorts and Q-sort analysis. The results of the Q-method generated a list of statements for which a preliminary list of indicators was then developed by a team of experts from the fields of environmental science, sustainable development and psychology. Subsequently members of the public evaluated the preliminary list of indicators, to select a final list of indicators that were both technically sound and incorporated the views of the public. The utilisation of the Q-method in this process was evaluated using previously published criteria. The application of the Q-method in this context needs to be considered not only by the quality of the indicators developed, but also from the perspective of the benefit of the process to the participants. It was concluded that the Q-method provided an effective framework for public participation in the selection of indicators as it allowed the public to discuss sustainable development in familiar language and in the context of their daily lives. By combining this information with expert input, a list of technically robust indicators that resonate with the public was developed. The results demonstrated that many citizens are not aware of sustainable development, and if it is to be successfully communicated to them, then indicators and policy need to be couched in terms familiar and relevant to citizen and communities.<br><h1>The interface between land use systems research and policy: Multiple arrangements and leverages</h1><br><b>Autores: </b>B.

It has been argued from within the science domain that the management of land, whether at the field, farm or regional scale, can benefit from computer-based systems analysis. This proposition was examined through 26 semi-structured interviews, by conducting a workshop on modelling support in policy decision-making and investigating 11 European-based cases of policy-oriented modelling research. On basis of these materials, we assess approaches towards policy-oriented modelling within the domain of agricultural production and other environmental services of land. First, we define the boundary arrangements for our field of interest, i.e. computer-based systems analysis of agricultural production and ecosystems services. Such ideotypical classification of boundary arrangements makes explicit the institutional space in which system scientists function. This space enables certain activities, and at the same time constrains other initiatives, dependent on who is perceived to initiate and/or control research activities and to formulate objectives, and whether it is considered appropriate to integrate scientific knowledge development with policy work. Five ideotypical boundary arrangements are proposed: ‘Civil mandate’; ‘Trickle out’; ‘Janus face’; ‘Critical participant’; and ‘Knowledge broker’. In a second step, a number of critical leverage points are identified based on the 11 cases and these are addressed in relation to the five boundary arrangements. The term ‘leverage point’ covers means, conditions and methods that foster use of modelling work that can be changed, and thus may be part of a strategy to increase the chances that a model is used. The leverage points were: reputation of research institute and/or scientists; raising and balancing expectations; communication about and investment in the scientific basis of the modelling work; participation in model development; heterogeneous and extensive social network in policy domain; institute mandate that secures availability of ‘stepping stones’. We conceive of two applications of our research for modellers who are interested in the use of their work in the policy sphere. First, the boundary arrangement classification helps to interpret the experiences of others and to assess the relevance of lessons and suggestions for their own context. Secondly, the combination of the boundary arrangement perspective and critical leverage points presents a basis to design an institutional pathway for enhancing impact of modelling research in the policy sphere. For those researchers functioning in a science-domain-oriented environment, the analysis in this paper suggests that there are more options than the frequently proposed ‘more participation’ for increasing the likelihood that their policy-oriented work is used. These include establishing contacts with research groups or institutes that are in a position to function as ‘stepping stones’, or engaging with others to develop a social network in the policy sphere.</BODY></HTML>
