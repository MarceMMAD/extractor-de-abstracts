  Abstract                 = {The production and publishing of content has become much more technically challenging than writing copy within a communications strategy. Content is not part of some supply chain, where you create, publish, and archive. Content has a lifecycle that is complex and often iterative. Web publishing, in particular, has unique needs. Publishing now requires a level of planning that addresses the technical and business requirements, and the editorial, social, and process aspects of publishing in a holistic way. Content strategy is a comprehensive plan that builds a framework to create, manage, deliver, share, and archive or renew content in reliable ways. Content strategy is an emerging discipline, already making its mark with improved returns on investment and internal efficiencies in the way governments provide information, support transactions, and foster citizen engagement.

  Abstract                 = {This chapter is meant as a preliminary introduction to experimental landscape cartography. It sets an exploratory path towards a chorographic metrics able to convey the social meaning of territory. I analyze the profound changes that have occurred in contemporary cartographic production, especially those investing the role of the interpreter and those related to the unprecedented social needs that maps are called upon to address. First I will consider the outcomes that Information Technology (IT) has had on mapping in promoting a wide range of new production sites and new professional profiles for cartographers. Then I will survey the social landscape that shows cartography’s involvement in the practices of democratization, both within governance policies or territorial planning and in terms of citizen access to data from public institutions. Finally, I will discuss the issue of participation in the collection of cartographic data and propose a model, pioneered in the field of environmental protection in Africa. I will present a methodology, called \{SIGAP\} (Geographic Information Systems for Protected Areas), which takes charge of the entire process of cartographic construction and produces participatory tools based on the use of geographic information systems (GIS). That will lead us to reflect on the semantic consequences of the availability of \{GIS\} tools online and, more specifically, to consider interactivity as a participatory potential for web-based cartography. This chapter will therefore provide a reflection on the importance of method for retrieving cartographic data; on the vital role of participation in the construction of maps; and on the potential WebGIS offer to promote such participation. These are essential conditions for rendering landscape in modes that pave the way to a chorography.∗ },

  Abstract                 = {Summary Civic engagement is held to be good for one and all, but much ambiguity surrounds the concept and its application. We examine conceptual, theoretical, and measurement issues in the study of civic engagement; review findings on trends and life course variation; discuss implications of civic engagement for older adults and for society; and consider directions for further research. Publisher Summary Interest in the civic engagement of older Americans has increased considerably among social scientists, policymakers, and governmental and nonprofit leaders for several reasons. Dramatic gains in health, education, and longevity over the past half century have increased individuals' capacity for civic roles and contributions in later life. Prompted by research linking civic engagement with healthy, successful aging, policymakers and government officials are interested in promoting service opportunities for older Americans that can benefit society as well as the volunteers themselves. Finally, facing an escalating demand for social services and concerns about the loss of traditional volunteers—especially housewives—nonprofit sector leaders have stepped up efforts to enlist the growing population of older persons to help fill the gap. This chapter examines civic engagement from the perspectives of conceptual and theoretical issues and measurement issues. It provides an overview of findings on trends and life course variation in civic engagement; and discusses implications of civic engagement for older adults and for society, respectively. Evidence to date indicates that civic engagement benefits both participants and the broader community. Recent research has sought to identify civic engagement as a formal retirement role, distinguished in terms of level of commitment that goes beyond the act of volunteering itself. },

  Abstract                 = {In an effort to engage citizens in “upstream” dialogues, a number of “experiments in public engagement” with science took place during 2005–2006. This chapter discusses those engagements, with a particular focus on the findings of a “nanodialogue” held in Zimbabwe during July 2006 involving scientists and representatives of two communities that experience real problems with the supply of clean drinking water. Concerns of society often focus on risk and this has been found to be especially true when public engagement is delayed. Upstream engagement appears to encourage the public to focus on imagining positive outcomes for nanotechnologies. We raise issues in relation to the purpose of new science, such as nanotechnology. The chapter puts forward a model where human need rather than just consumer wants might influence the development of nanotechnologies. The chapter ends with some speculation about future directions that are desirable if the social and ethical concerns of society are to be met. The dialogues held in Zimbabwe are one small step towards this new direction. They connect the needs of poor people with scientists who are in the process of developing new applications of nanotechnologies. The next step will be to move beyond dialogue towards the engagement of the scientist with relevant stakeholders in developing countries. },

Defense counsel can be paid for by the defendant or provided through public defenders and assigned counsel. In a pro se defense the defendant represents him- or herself. The prosecutor is elected and represents the state. Several methods exist to select judges, including partisan and nonpartisan election, and appointment. The Missouri Plan combines appointment and elective processes. Juries are panels of citizens authorized to make judicial decisions; they are selected in voir dire by defense counsel and prosecutors. Grand juries review evidence and determine formal charges. Petit juries are trial juries. The issues of speedy trial, the courtroom work group, free press/fair trial, community courts, plea bargaining, citizen/victim participation, and the impact of technology are important. A recent trend is problem-oriented courts, ranging from courts focused on specific offenses/offenders, such as drug courts, to courts designed to address broad problems of the community.

Students in human-computer interaction courses learn early (and often) about how important it is to understand one's users. “User-centered design” is a well-known process involving the participation of representatives of the target user group at all stages of the design process. Design innovation can be supported by thinking through categories of activity or need. Shneiderman's activity-relationship framework is a tool to generate possible technologies to support people as they act in various relationship roles, such as a member of a family or a citizen. Three broad classes of activity spaces that are outside formal learning contexts include play; interests and hobbies; and communication, self-expression, and identity. The chapter discusses some of the emerging interaction techniques that could play interesting roles in future children's mobile technologies each activity type and highlight aspects that might inspire design proposals. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The conclusion of the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) in 1994 established a minimum baseline for regulating access to technology and knowledge goods. This global regime of intellectual property rights has since been a contentious aspect of modern economic relations. It has been viewed by consumers around the world as a significant barrier to access to technology and associated knowledge goods, including stymieing opportunities for social and political engagement by citizens. Public disenchantment with intellectual property as a primary regulator of access to technology could be addressed by the explicit linkage of proprietary rights to a new welfare axis comprised of development aspirations, human rights norms, and liberty considerations. To the extent social norms that develop around new technologies facilitate positive returns recognized by these complementary legal regimes, intellectual property rights that are in tension with these regimes will likely continue to lose moral sway, making the future of the \{TRIPS\} Agreement far less stable and its minimum obligations more costly to enforce. Moreover, gaps in how formal law and social norms regulate technology are not easily captured by the rigid prescriptions of treaty provisions, and thus the \{TRIPS\} Agreement is far less capable of serving the important role of shaping contemporary approaches to access to technology. As technology continues to reach deep into the private lives of citizens, and to affect the capacity and trajectory of national development in less-advanced economies, the design and construction of formal laws around which technology is produced, disseminated, and used will have greater import if they purposefully accommodate other legal orders whose norms resonate powerfully in advancing stylized visions of societal progress and human well-being. },

Public service employees began making extensive use of the internet and the web in about 2000. One key development, dating from about 2009, is the desire by senior politicians for the public to become more involved with government through online interaction. Taken to its extreme, theoretically, all major decisions could be made by citizens effectively instantaneously, by online voting. The information technology that is the subject of this book is Web 2.0, which concerns the ability to share information on the web, for users, especially the general public, to collaborate. The significance of Web 2.0 is outlined, and the participation–collaboration pattern, the declarative living pattern and the tag gardening pattern are explained.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Over the last decade, a consensus within the \{UK\} and across Europe has emerged: that the considerable wealth of knowledge and expertise in universities and colleges can and should be harnessed to make a more direct contribution to the economy and society than through graduates alone, and that government support should stimulate this. At the same time, we have experienced an explosion of new web technologies, an increasing amount of business conducted online and a digital world where information is king, but where the kingdom is widely accessible, global and multi-faceted, and the use and context of that information is often more significant than the information itself. In this technology-driven world, open innovation, crowd-sourcing and open access to research are among the key areas of innovation creating new opportunities for universities and businesses alike. The Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) Business and Community Engagement (BCE) Programme was designed in 2007 to help \{UK\} institutions rise to these challenges and opportunities through the effective use of technology, by supporting and developing their strategic management of relationships with external partners (commercial, public sector including charities and trusts, cultural, social and civic organisations), and providing resources to enable this. This chapter describes the context and development of the \{JISC\} Business and Community Programme 2007–10 and discusses the key achievements. },
