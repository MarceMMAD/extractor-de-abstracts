N2  - AbstractThe author advocates for the unique ability of science museums to educate visitors in socio-science and technology issues that influence policy, and also discusses the potential pitfalls museums face if programs step beyond the foundational science of subjective social issues, or more hazardously, mingle with politics. He analyzes three approaches open to museums navigating these territories, with examples of their exploratory implementation at the Museum of Science, Boston, ultimately concluding that the museum field should explore all three areas in tandem with the social science community. These three approaches?1) providing social science context for science issues; 2) becoming forums for dialog and debate; and 3) providing mechanisms for public views to be shared with scientists and policy makers?differ from the individual-based informal education ideals with which Bell and many museum professionals began their careers, reflecting the increasingly global nature of citizenry that museums may help to nurture.

N2  - The literature on political participation indicates that initiating contacts with the government is a vital form of civic engagement. Using this criterion to define participation, some researchers claim that students in general are apathetic about government and have poor efficacy about public affairs. The present study examines this assumption by exploring 18 factors that may influence college-student-initiated contact with federal, state, and local governments. A survey is administered to a random sample of 3500 students in five American states, namely Mississippi, Louisiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Georgia. Findings suggest that students are neither apathetic nor lacking efficacy as 64% of them have initiated at least one contact in a 12-month period and many have even contacted more than once. Using multiple regression reveals that 11 factors influence students' contacting, namely age, level at college, gender, needs, efficacy, political and civic affiliation, final recipient of services, goods and information, role of teachers, class discussions, campus environment, and availability of computers and the Internet. These findings and their implications are discussed in detail.

N2  - The relationship between digital video technologies, practitioners and the possibility spaces in which nascent digital video practices assemble relies on the dynamic engagement between technological possibilities and creative practices. This paper examines the relationship between practitioners, technology and technological infrastructure within documentary media practices that emerged in and around the Occupy Wall Street movement.In locales with well-connected infrastructure, the collaboration between hardware, software and global communications networks, often allows for makers of digital video to rapidly upload footage to real-time online platforms. Although quick uploading capacity appears to offer a relative ease of documentation, the immediacy of publication can be at once liberating and exceedingly complex in both the ethical and creative quandaries that may arise, for example, from the live streaming of political protests. How might relationships between live streaming and documentary methods of video production offer the practitioner and the audience a clearer sense of how documentary may or may not be evolving as a constantly changing, experimental and creative form of storytelling? This paper will examine the intricacies and ethics of these evolving relationships through an examination of the evolution of Tim Pool's live streaming practice that came to prominence during the Occupy Wall Street movement.

N2  - This paper presents the structure of an undergraduate course entitled ?programming techniques and the use of specialised software in structural engineering? which is offered to the fifth (final) year students of the Civil Engineering Department of Aristotle University Thessaloniki in Greece. The aim of this course is to demonstrate the use of new information technologies in the field of structural engineering and to teach modern programming and finite element simulation techniques that the students can in turn apply in both research and everyday design of structures. The course also focuses on the physical interpretation of structural engineering problems, in a way that the students become familiar with the concept of computational tools without losing perspective from the engineering problem studied. For this purpose, a wide variety of structural engineering problems are studied in class, involving structural statics, dynamics, earthquake engineering, design of reinforced concrete and steel structures as well as data and information management. The main novelty of the course is that it is taught and examined solely in the computer laboratory ensuring that each student can accomplish the prescribed ?hands-on? training on a dedicated computer, strictly on a 1:1 student over hardware ratio. Significant effort has also been put so that modern educational techniques and tools are utilised to offer the course in an essentially paperless mode. This involves electronic educational material, video tutorials, student information in real time and exams given and assessed electronically through an ad hoc developed, personalised, electronic system. The positive feedback received from the students reveals that the concept of a paperless course is not only applicable in real academic conditions but is also a promising approach that significantly increases student productivity and engagement. The question, however, is whether such an investment in educational technology is indeed timely during economic recession, where the academic priorities are rapidly changing. In the light of this unfavourable and unstable financial environment, a critical overview of the strengths, the weaknesses, the opportunities and the threats of this effort is presented herein, hopefully contributing to the discussion on the future of higher education in the time of crisis.

N2  - Civic journalism, the community-inclusive cooperative model that has faded in the United States, where it had first blossomed, has the potential to be re-purposed to provide security for journalists in areas where it can be dangerous to practise the traditional Western-objective model. The Philippines, where journalists in recent years have been killed at the highest rate in the world, provides an illustrative case study for this concept because of its Westernised, vigorous press and the violent insurgencies that have continued in some provincial areas. Recent experiments with civic journalism in the Philippines under corporate sponsorship suggest how adaptations of the model might help organise effective news reporting, supported by local citizens, to inform safer and more effective press practices in regions such as the island of Mindanao where journalists have been particularly endangered. Our discussion of experiments with civic journalism suggests that it might be more widely applied to organising popular support for journalists engaged in reporting on difficult topics that are important to resolving conflict and furthering development in underdeveloped and unstable regions.

N2  - AbstractThe lay Catholic, ordained, and religious today are faced with making legal and medical decisions that will affect their health care during a time of incapacity and eventually the final moments of their life. Often times the response to the need for sound legal and medical instructions is met by non-profit, pro-life organizations which provide legal forms such as powers of attorney. By and large, these documents are morally in line with Catholic Church teaching, but do very little for practical application of the law as it interfaces with medicine in the crucible of the emergency room and courtroom. Thus, the ?culture of death? which pervades both the professions of law and medicine, and which veils itself in euphemisms such as a ?patient's right to die,? creates pragmatic challenges to pre-printed legal documents which may vary from what are statutory in form for individual states. Thus, the promotion of ?living wills? is tantamount to the expression of a fear and human desire to escape suffering at all costs. Accordingly, when Catholic physicians are informed of the legal and moral obligations owed to their patients through various estate planning documents, and Catholic lawyers seek to provide an integrated approach to drafting legal documents which include various provisions grounded in Catholic bioethical teaching, documents such as ?living wills? and ?advanced directives to physicians? ultimately are seen as unnecessary. Thus, engaging the culture of death is best accomplished when both physician and attorney work in their respective fields of practice by discussing the morality of various bioethical decisions with their patients and clients without fear of legal reprisal or recrimination.

Analyzing data from a 2013 survey of LGBT adults (N = 1,197), we find that those who use social media for connective activities, (e.g., to meet new LGBT friends, discuss LGBT issues), are significantly more likely to engage in boycotts or buycotts to promote equality. We find significant interactions between connective social media use and political interest. Specifically, connective social media use mobilizes people with low levels of political interest to participate and reinforces the likelihood that people with high levels of political interest participate.

N2  - Geospatial technologies can be used in many intervention stages, from adaptation to disaster relief, and also in disaster response situations. These technological tools have been shown to have a transformative power on the quality and efficacy of response efforts. This paper focuses on the risk reduction phase. This phase is a continuous endeavor aimed at increasing resilience. For example, in the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, groups of remotely stationed volunteers remapped Haiti using satellite imagery. Forces on the ground used this imagery to print maps using OpenStreetMap (OSM). Using cell-phone text messages, Short Message Service (SMS) response forces were able to locate and rescue citizens. The Ushahidi platform and OSM created a new paradigm for disaster response in which residents take the lead in operations. Unfortunately, this was able to happen only after the disaster hit. The following paper suggests a roadmap for the integration of crowd-sourcing tools and geospatial collaboration for the disaster preparedness phase. This multitiered proposal connects proper planning processes that engage the community, reduce risk, and ultimately provide for a more resilient community. The paper also aims to take the new disaster response paradigm and use it in the urban planning process. Rather than being a separate process, the disaster preparedness phase should enhance and strengthen communities, resulting in their becoming stronger and more resilient.

N2  - Studies of urban metabolism provide important insights for environmental management of cities, but are not widely used in planning practice due to a mismatch of data scale and coverage. This paper introduces the Spatial Allocation of Material Flow Analysis (SAMFA) model as a potential decision support tool aimed as a contribution to overcome some of these difficulties and describes its pilot use at the county level in the Republic of Ireland. The results suggest that SAMFA is capable of identifying hotspots of higher material and energy use to support targeted planning initiatives, while its ability to visualise different policy scenarios supports more effective multi-stakeholder engagement. The paper evaluates this pilot use and sets out how this model can act as an analytical platform for the industrial ecology?spatial planning nexus.

N2  - The provision of online news provides unique opportunities for users to interact with content and with other users. One of the more common forms of interactivity involves commenting on news stories. These interactive features are often heralded for enabling virtual public discussion of current events. Yet there exists a widespread belief that these spaces fail to meet that lofty goal, instead exhibiting hostile and vitriolic discourse, which undermines the deliberative potential of online interaction. At the same time, there is a lack of consensus among researchers regarding the proper conceptualization of hostility, and its more desirable counterpart, civility. This article aims to integrate normative and contextual conceptual definitions of hostility and civility in online interactions with the news. Building on these, we develop operational definitions of the two concepts and analyze the presence of hostile and civil discussion in user comments posted to YouTube news videos. Further, we explore the possibility that the content and source of those news videos, as well as popularity and engagement metrics, may explain the degree of hostility and civility in comments.

N2  - As a result of globalisation and changing technologies, young people are increasingly required to engage with the broader world beyond their local and national communities. This raises significant questions about the ways and spaces in which young people will need to engage as active citizens, and the new tools and resources that young people will need to equip them for their futures. The Global Connections Program has been developed to address these identified needs. It is a youth-led global learning initiative which aims to provide an opportunity for connection and learning among young people in Australia and Indonesia. This article explores Plan's youth-led approach to global learning, with a focus on the implementation and evaluation findings of the Global Connections Program, as well as the challenges faced thus far.

N2  - Character and citizenship education are part of the vision of many countries, including Singapore. Ensuring they are implemented in academic environments, service learning has been shown to be a natural bridge between the two. Research has shown that service learning, when done well, produces outcomes related to character development and citizenship education. As a modern educational movement, its early founders described it as a pedagogy to engage individuals in service activities dictated by the community, whereby the learning applies academic subject matter to the service. It is also a philosophy where the service is developed in collaboration with the community, where the goal is empowering those most affected by social and economic challenges. It is often delivered through academic course connections, but is effectively developed through constructivist approaches to curriculum, where the community prescribed needs define the subjects required for study and service. Service learning and character education are mutually connected constructs where service learning becomes the vehicle for delivery of character development. Individuals learn good character by applying those character traits in social settings through service. Good learning is assured when the nature of the service and character are intertwined, and the knowledge and skills gained connect directly to the actions of the people involved.

N2  - The focus of the paper is on the transformative effect on student learning and engagement that results from using contemporary Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools and directed reflection to engage in spatial learning about the politics (literally) surrounding the student. I report on the pedagogical advantages of using spatial analysis (especially embedded in GIS maps) and reflection to foster student engagement with, and learning of, the multidisciplinary foundations of local political conflicts. I present a community politics course that employs GIS (emphasizing goals and learning methods), discuss new developments in GIS tools that enable projects such as the one evaluated here, describe the neighborhood analysis project used in the course and present a detailed, multi-semester assessment of student projects that employs both qualitative data based on student reflections and a more quantitative review of their work. This paper provides a discussion and assessment of applying (GIS) technology to student self-awareness of, and engagement with, political issues in their own hometown.

N2  - In a liberal democracy, the evolution of political agendas and formation of policy involves deliberation: serious consideration of political issues. Modern-day political participation is dependent on widespread deliberation supported by information and communication technologies, which also offer the potential to revitalize and transform citizen engagement in democracy. Although the majority of Web 2.0 systems enable these discourses to some extent, government institutions commission and manage specialized deliberation systems (information systems designed to support participative discourse) intended to promote citizen engagement. The most common examples of these are political discussion forums. Although usually considered trivial adaptations of well-known technologies, these types of deliberative systems are often unsuccessful, and present a distinct set of design and management challenges. In this article, the authors analyze the issues involved in establishing political deliberation systems under four headings: stakeholder engagement, Web platform design, service management, political process reshaping, and evaluation and improvement. We review the existing literature and present a longitudinal case study: the Norwegian Demokratitorget (Democracy Square). We define key issues in each of the four areas, which need to be understood to design and manage a successful net-based deliberation forum.

N2  - Abstract This essay examines the new forms of civic and political engagement that the increasing accessibility of internet-based media has precipitated in the Bulgarian context. It discusses the results of three case studies which focus respectively on online forum discussions of a significant political event; a campaign of eco-protests; and the activism emerging from a website and forum dedicated to motherhood. The essay argues that new media have brought civic and political issues and the possibility to deliberate and act on them into the everyday lives of Bulgarians. As a result, the voice of Bulgarian civil society has grown stronger and has been able to penetrate the sphere of formal politics, sometimes with important consequences.

N2  - ABSTRACTCivic engagement is an important marker of thriving among adolescents, and more research is needed that clarifies the ecological assets (positive supports across settings) that foster youth civic engagement. Simultaneously modeling associations between multiple ecological assets and civic behaviors can provide a nuanced view of the way adolescents? ecological assets relate to distinct forms of civic engagement. To advance positive youth development theory, we used a bifactor modeling approach to examine general and specific ecological asset factors in relation to volunteering, conventional political, online political, and informal helping behaviors. In a large ethnically diverse sample of adolescents, the general ecological asset factor was positively associated with informal helping only. Classroom civic learning opportunities were positively associated with volunteering, conventional, and online political behaviors. Family political discussions were positively associated with conventional and online political behaviors. Our study suggests that civic engagement should be understood multidimensionally and that broad and specific ways of conceptualizing ecological assets have merit for understanding different types of youth civic engagement.

N2  - The interface between neogeography and citizen science has great potential for environmental monitoring, but this nexus has been explored less often than each subject individually. In this article we review the emerging role of volunteered geographic information in citizen science and present a case study of an integrated tool set that engages multiple types of users (from targeted citizen-based observation networks, expert-driven focused monitoring, and opportunistic crowdsourcing efforts) in monitoring a forest disease in the western United States. We first introduce the overall challenge of data collection in environmental monitoring projects and then discuss the literature surrounding an emergent integration of citizen science and volunteered geographical information. We next explore how these methods characterize and underpin knowledge discovery and how multimodal interaction is supported so that a large spectrum of contributors can be included. These concepts are summarized in a conceptual model that articulates the important gradients of Web-based environmental monitoring: the users, the interaction between users and data, and the types of information generated. Using this model, we critically examine OakMapper.org, a Web site created by the authors to collect and distribute spatial information related to the spread of a forest disease, and discuss many of the core issues and new challenges presented by the intersection of citizen science and volunteered geographic information in the context of environmental monitoring. We argue that environmental monitoring can benefit from this synergy: The increased emphasis on a diversity of participants in knowledge production might help to reduce the gaps that have in the past divided the public, researchers, and policymakers in such efforts.

This article discusses findings from a recent promenade initiative, commissioned for a UK arts festival, along with a review of literature, to critically engage with growing evidence of the diverse ways in which technology is integrated at direct user level. Concepts of ?hybrid spaces? and ?user agency? are discussed, along with the ?performativity? of spaces. Central to the discussion is the function of narrative in engaging the participant to construct new perspectives, which are facilitated by the mediating role of personal media devices between subject, narrative, space and community.

N2  - Abstract This Special Issue of the Canadian Journal of Science, Mathematics and Technology Education is aimed at extending the dialogue on socioscientific issues (SSIs) research, with an emphasis on the use of controversy in educational contexts. The emergence of research on SSIs can be understood in terms of: calls for renewal in science curriculum that set the stage for teaching scientific concepts and processes within a rich social, political, and ethical context; the development of a scientific and technical culture; a new alliance between science education and citizenship education; and increased interest in the use of argumentation in science education. Debates at the international level about deep changes in the modes of knowledge production; relationships across science, technology, society, and environment (STSE); and educational forms, contents, and aims have prompted the inclusion of issues and controversial topics in education. In our editorial we offer our thoughts on SSIs in school science and technology?in English (written by Erminia and Virginie) and in French (written by Virginie). Though the pieces were written independently emphasizing different aspects of SSIs, they also contain many overlapping ideas. We finish the editorial with a summary of the seven contributions to the Special Issue and hope that you enjoy the opportunity to engage with the arguments contained in the articles.

N2  - This paper captures the online discourse on BT Brinjal (Bacillus Thuringiensis Brinjal) in an online forum initiated by www.greenpeace.org in 2010 following the government?s decision to palm off the hybrid variety to farmers. In addition, the study provides insight into the ?tones? and ?perspectives? of the discussions surrounding BT Brinjal mostly in opposing the cultural shift from the organic to the genetically modified crop the government was attempting to impose on the social consciousness of the public and especially farmers. The study takes off from the Habermas public sphere theory applied to the interactive potential of the Internet. Deliberative and democratic social actions through the participation of citizens in the digital medium do not produce groups that arrive at a consensus. Instead, what is engendered are different publics, smaller, loosely connected, and engaging in ideology-based issues, producing polyvocal discourses.

Starting with geo-located Twitter and Foursquare data for the New York City region in 2014, we applied spatial clustering techniques to detect significant groupings or ?neighborhoods? where social media use is high or low. The results show that beyond the business districts, digital neighborhoods occur in communities undergoing shifting socio-demographics. Neighborhoods that are not digitally oriented tend to have higher proportion of minorities and lower incomes, highlighting a social?economic divide in how social media is used in the city. Understanding the differences in these neighborhoods can help city planners interested in generating economic development proposals, civic engagement strategies, and urban design ideas that target these areas.

N2  - Tackling complex urban problems requires us to examine and leverage diverse sources of information. Today, cities capture large amounts of information in real-time. Data are captured on transportation patterns, electricity and water consumption, citizen use of government services (e.g., parking meters), and even on weather events. Through open data initiatives, government agencies are making information available to citizens. In turn, citizens are building applications that exploit this information to solve local urban problems. Citizens are also building platforms where they can share information regarding government services. Information that was previously unavailable is now being used to gauge quality of services, choose services, and report illegal and unethical behaviors (e.g., requesting bribes). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to examine the range of citizen applications (?citizen apps?) targeting urban issues and to address their effects on urban planning, decision-making, problem solving, and governance. We examine citizen apps that address a wide range of urban issues from those that solve public transportation challenges to those that improve the management of public utilities and services and even public safety.

N2  - Public participation has become standard practice in both environmental communication and science and technology studies, with such engagement increasingly moving ?upstream? to the early stages of technological development. One framework for these activities is anticipatory governance, in which foresight and public and stakeholder engagement are used to reflect on?and direct?the impacts of new technology. In this essay we draw on our experience of anticipatory governance, in the shape of the ?NanoFutures? project on energy futures, to present a reflexive analysis of engagement and deliberation. We draw out five tensions of the practice of deliberation on energy technologies. Through tracing the lineages of these dilemmas, we discuss some of the implications of these tensions for the practice of civic engagement and deliberation in a set of questions for this community of practitioner-scholars.

N2  - Media culture is a firm part of youth cultures today. Media can also be seen as one empowering technology in the information society alongside traditional school and government. What kind of civic identities are young people constructing in contemporary media culture? This article discusses media-saturated youth and audience agency, drawing on Dahlgren's ideas of civic culture. Relying on empirical data from two case studies in Finland, we will introduce a typology of civic identities, which the young construct as members of the public in relation to media. Our first case study is a youth civic website called Vaikuttamo.net and the second is the Youth Voice Editorial Board, which consists of a group of young people producing news for mainstream media. Our research supports various earlier observations that young people are firmly engaged, though to a lesser extent, in the formal political realm. We particularly want to emphasize the role of the local media and the expressive potential of young people. The media should be noted as a public forum where cultural and political modes of expression and participation can be mixed ? not only in global online media, but also in more traditional local media such as television and newspaper. The research shows that young people are also willing to enter generational public discussions about civic issues instead of keeping to their own forums of media publicity.

N2  - This article critically examines the invocation of democracy in the discourse of audience participation in digital journalism. Rather than simply restate the familiar grand narratives that traditionally described journalism's function for democracy (information source, watchdog, public representative, mediation for political actors), we compare and contrast conceptualisations of the audience found within these and discuss how digital technologies impact these relationships. We consider how ?participatory? transformations influence perceptions of news consumption and draw out analytic distinctions based on structures of participation and different levels of engagement. This article argues that the focus in digital journalism is not so much on citizen engagement but rather audience or user interaction; instead of participation through news, the focus is on participation in news. This demands we distinguish between minimalist and maximalist versions of participation through interactive tools, as there is a significant distinction between technologies that allow individuals to control and personalise content (basic digital control) and entire platforms that easily facilitate the storytelling and distribution of citizen journalism within public discourse (integrative structural participation). Furthermore, commercial interests tend to dominate the shaping of digital affordances, which can lead to individualistic rather than collective conceptualisations. This article concludes by considering what is gained as well as lost when grand visions of journalism's roles for democracy are appropriated or discarded in favour of a participation paradigm to conceptualise digital journalism.

N2  - ABSTRACTThis study examines the impact of using Twitter in the classroom on student political efficacy, interest, and engagement. Millennials use the virtual world to build social relationships and to obtain information. By envisioning the virtual world as a means to increase civic engagement, political science instructors can use technology to draw upon social networking, iterated interaction, and information sharing. Because taking political science and civics courses can boost civic engagement, students who are drawn to political science courses are more likely to already be interested in politics and have an increased knowledge. Therefore, what we demonstrate is that, while Twitter in and of itself does not independently foster civic engagement, employing it as a pedagogical tool taps into and strengthens the predispositions of students in political science classes, namely political interest and efficacy. Our results contribute to a fresh and much needed discussion in political science literature about ways to increase civic engagement of Millennials.

N2  - Personalisation is a new term that is being used in different ways. Often it is used as a shorthand for a range of new forms of practice, or technologies. These new technologies include direct payments, self-directed support, individual budgets and person-centred planning. The values which underpin these technologies have developed from the experiences of disabled people, but these values are not well represented in theories of social justice. This paper describes a new theory, a Citizenship Theory of social justice, that is based on two fundamental moral beliefs: (a) the equal dignity of all human beings; and (b) the positive value of human diversity and difference. Developing this theory of social justice leads to an inclusive model of citizenship and an imperative to organise society so that everyone can become a citizen. Social workers could see personalisation as an externally imposed dogma, but this will lead to defensiveness, resistance and cynicism. However the profession could instead embrace the technologies of personalisation, and the Citizenship Theory that should underpin it. It is this second path that will lead to critical engagement and the practical use and improvement of the tools of personalisation.

N2  - Research on transnational advocacy networks has tended to focus on how non-state actors from developed countries interact with those from developing countries to pressure states, often by drawing in liberal Western states. This article adds a different perspective, focusing on how local civil society actors in different locales interact with each other to persuade their own governments ?from below?. It examines how these actors facilitate norm emergence amongst Asian states on issues with little domestic traction and for which there are well-developed international norms, standards and procedures. In studying the way local civil society actors conduct norm entrepreneurship, it is important to recognise the political, material and ideational conditions that constrain their work; their positionality and fragility in their own societies; and the way they relate to other actors working on the same issues. Focusing on the case of the Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network, it is argued that working through a formalised network has changed the ways and the conditions under which local civil society actors engage in norm entrepreneurship on refugee protection. It has changed the attributes of actors, helping them develop visibility, capacity and connectedness through the formation of a ?community of practice?; it has changed power relations between them and other actors ? in particular, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; it has facilitated the development of ?regional imagination? and the practice of ?scale shifting?, helping local actors move beyond domestic contexts to engage with state and non-state actors through regional and international fora. It has also introduced shifts in the dynamics of norm entrepreneurship by introducing a new actor ? the network itself, which exercises agency through a Secretariat ? and intra-network sensitivities, which need careful attention to prevent member disengagement.

Hitherto, the failure to bring the politics back in and integrate community voices into the process of policy development has proved the major obstacle to the achievement of a balanced social and environmental perspective in the Murray Darling Basin (MDB) and has served to reinforce traditional prejudices. This article makes four main contributions to the study of communities experiencing stress. Firstly, we present the case for deep local democratization in times of stress. Secondly, we build on a diagnostic tool ? the Can do Like to Enabled to Asked to Responded to (CLEAR) model ? to evaluate the effectiveness of the consultation process underpinning the Guide to the Murray Darling Basin Plan (MDBP) and apply it to the Forbes consultation. Thirdly and fourthly, we use the findings from this evaluation to identify principles of community engagement which provide the best possible conditions for effective social mobilization and the capabilities that are necessary to deliver effective citizen-centric policy outcomes in communities experiencing high levels of stress

N2  - The inflow of migrant workers poses many challenges to an ethnically homogenous Korean society. They have different features with regard to citizenship. In this article, I analyze the citizenship of migrant workers in Korea from three dimensions ? immigration policies, access to long-term and permanent residency and national citizenship, and the rights of migrant workers. First, I analyze requirements for employment and residency as stipulated in the Departures and Arrivals Control Act and the problems of differential application to target groups. Second, I discuss regulations in the Departures and Arrivals Control Act and the Nationality Act concerning the length of stay and requirements and process of applying for long-term and permanent residency, or Korean nationality. Third, I go over the basic rights of migrant workers: (1) civil rights; (2) social rights such as the rights to engage in work, the three primary rights of labor, social welfare rights, and the right to education of children of migrant workers; and (3) political rights including residents' rights for local autonomy. I closely analyze the difference in citizenship according to visa status and try to pinpoint key social problems of today. I also reflect on the desirable direction of Korea's immigration policies.

N2  - AbstractBoth public and private organizations are increasingly employing stakeholder engagement as an important strategy for improving external stakeholder relations. Incorporating stakeholders? opinions is valuable for improving decision-making processes and project implementation [Deelstra, Nooteboom, Kohlmann, van den Berg,  Reed et al. (2009) Who?s in and why? A typology of stakeholder analysis methods for natural resource management. Journal of Environmental Management, 90(5), 1933?1949], has been insufficiently explored. At present, there is no integrated stakeholder analysis method that investigates the stakeholder sufficiently, i.e., from multiple space?time subjectivities, rather then from a single space?time representation. To arrive at an integrated stakeholder analysis methodology, Reed et al. (2009) have suggested investigating the potential for combining existing methods to derive more useful results. This article will therefore offer a new integrated framework, covering all components; salience, frames of reference and networks.

N2  - Human settlements have long been located on rivers, and the relationship of the place to the river functions as a deep reflection of its historical, cultural, and socio-economic traditions. This paper explores urban river revitalization in contemporary China, focusing particularly on ongoing efforts to clean up Foshan's polluted Fenjiang River. The research shows that the traditional cultural status of the waterway, which is known as the ?Mother River? of Foshan, plays a paradoxically pivotal role in the project to modernize it. Interacting in complex ways with domestic and international political concerns, and popular media and internet technologies, the cultural status of the river has helped to determine both the type of environmental movement that has emerged in its defence, and the community of interests that serves as a proxy for civil society in that movement. Ultimately, this paper argues that the unique configuration of institutions and actors engaged in the Fenjiang River restoration project are emblematic of a new type of ?environmentalism with Chinese characteristics.?

N2  - ABSTRACTThis paper presents a case study on the teaching and learning of fluid mechanics at the University of Western Sydney (UWS), Australia, by applying a blended learning approach (BLA). In the adopted BLA, various flexible learning materials have been made available to the students such as online recorded lectures, online recorded tutorials, hand written tutorial solutions, discussion board and online practice quizzes. The lecture and tutorial class times have been primarily utilised to discuss confusing topics and engage students with practical issues in applying the theories learnt in fluid mechanics. Based on the data of over 734 students over a 4-year period, it has been shown that a BLA has improved the learning experience of the fluid mechanics students in UWS. The overall percentage of student satisfaction in this subject has increased by 18% in the BLA case compared with the traditional one.

N2  - ABSTRACTObtaining useful geographic information from the flood of user-generated geographic content (UGGC) data is of significant interest, but comes with challenges in an age of crowdsourcing. To address this issue, we adopt Maslow?s model of human needs to frame UGGC. Synthesizing across literature about volunteered geographic information and participatory GIS, we present a conceptual framework for characterizing collection of UGGC. The framework is composed of multiple dimensions and levels that include perspectives about motivations, participatory methods, and participants. We also articulate four levels of participants (stakeholders, core-engaged participants, semi-core-engaged participants, and engaged citizens) together with four work principles (communication, cooperation, coordination, and collaboration). Finally, a case study describes an example we use to evaluate the conceptual framework for its suitability in design of a UGGC system. We conclude by reflecting on how and why this framework offers a valuable perspective for deriving useful geographic information and offer future research directions.

N2  - Despite the rise of many new forms of public participation, citizens often find themselves on the sidelines of civic initiatives. Observing that nascent democratic capacities are an under-used resource for community development, this article explores how widely applied understandings of capacity building fail to recognize the democratic capacities of communities. By exploring notions of capacity that span the fields of community development and civic engagement, this discussion argues that both fields can improve their ability to address complex public problems by paying close attention to the inherent democratic capacities of a community?s citizens, organizations, and networks. It suggests a framework for recognizing and analyzing these democratic capacities. An overlapping ?democratic practices? framework is presented as a way to analyze how communities apply their democratic capacities. The article concludes with case studies from Cooperative Extension that illustrate how citizen-centered community development and civic engagement grounded in public deliberation and dialog can build on and strengthen the democratic capacities of communities.

N2  - This paper presents a critical framework applied to findings from a critical discourse analysis of curriculum and lesson plans in Alberta to examine the assumption that Canada is an ideal place for global citizenship education. The analysis draws on a framework that presents a critique of modernity to recognize a conflation within calls for new approaches to educating citizens for the twenty-first century. A main finding is that although the Alberta curriculum reflects important potential for promoting a critical approach, a conflation of different versions of liberalism often results in a false sense of multiple perspectives and a foreclosure of potential. The paper argues for a critical approach to global citizenship education that engages with the tensions inherent to issues of diversity rather than stepping over or reducing them to theoretically and conceptually vague ideas of universalism and consensus.

N2  - Once regarded as the most essential subject in the national curriculum vital for civilizing the public, English Literature has now lost its place of prominence. In this paper, I focus on Singapore where the subject was a core aspect of the colonial curriculum and where it is currently facing declining enrolment at the national examinations. In the first part of the paper, I discuss how Literature initially functioned to propagate colonial values education in Singapore and how, following Singapore's independence, its goals were overtaken by a nation-state model of values education. Limitations of this model provide the grounds for a transnational model of critical values education that, as I argue in the second part, may be powerfully conveyed through Literature. It is Literature's capacity to facilitate transnational critical engagements with values and explorations of identity especially involving highly sensitive aspects related to gender, race, and religion that represents the strongest justification in the light of its present demise. What Literature offers is the possibility of engaging with values beyond the confines of Empire or nation by grappling with essential questions about what it means to be a cosmopolitan as opposed to a nationalistic citizen inhabiting the world.

N2  - In the UK, the Civil Service Reform Plan is being implemented with urgency. This requires Civil Service departments and agencies to reform their structures and ways of working in order to deliver effective services in a climate of economic austerity and rapid social and technological change. Historically, Human Resource (HR) professionals have provided services based on the HR Business Partner model which has meant a focus on strategic and operational HR services. As part of these changes, HR managers and other professionals are now required to develop their capabilities in providing Organisation Development (OD) advice to their internal clients. In order to make this happen, the Civil Service's expert OD and Design Service launched an OD Capability Building programme and engaged OD specialists Mayvin to deliver it. The programme incorporates the postgraduate level-accredited Action Learning Question method developed by Dr Richard Hale called, in this context, OD Questions (ODQs). Participants on the OD Capability Building programme are required to complete an ODQ over a five- to six-month period. This entails scoping an OD challenge with key stakeholders, conducting some research and making recommendations for change or implementing such change. The participants work in ?action learning sets? and support each other with their problem solving and learning. A final report is written up by each participant leading to the award of postgraduate-level credits. Examples of ODQ areas include: How can I support a newly appointed Director General to align his team to address their challenges at a time of rapid change? How can I help my client department to improve employee engagement? How can I develop my own capability in working as a business partner and adding value alongside my client?

Robustness is the property of systems that enables them to survive unforeseen or unusual circumstances (Knoll & Vogel, 2009). Queensland University of Technology with industry collaboration is engaged in a program of research that commenced 15 years ago to study the impact of such unforeseeable phenomena and investigate methods of improving robustness and safety with protective mechanisms embedded or designed in structural systems. This paper highlights some of the research pertaining to seismic protection of building structures, rollover protective structures and effects of vehicular impact and blast on key elements in structures that could propagate catastrophic and disproportionate collapse.

N2  - AbstractThis study draws upon communication infrastructure theory to investigate how communication networks stimulate civic participation within a community development context. According to the communication infrastructure theory (CIT), local communication resources enable citizens to engage in collective action for the common good. The CIT proposes neighborhood storytelling networks (NSNs) as core communication assets: interpersonal discussion, connection to community organizations, and connection to local media, including traditional mass media and the Internet. To examine the relationship between NSN and civic participation, data were collected from a probabilistic, representative sample through a mail survey in a southeastern state (N = 1154) in the US. Analysis reveals that individual sociodemographic characteristics and community context factors predicted connections to the NSN in a distinct way and such connections yielded positive relationships with civic participation. These results carry important theoretical, practical, and policy-related implications.

N2  - ABSTRACTThis theoretical discussion about the impact of information and communication technologies on journalistic practices and the digital public spheres in West Africa, asks two key questions: 1) To what extent does the ICT-enabled impact on journalism practice contribute to the rejuvenation of the public sphere in African societies, and 2) What are the methodological changes of investigating these contributions? Scholars have argued that advances in ICTs can be used to initiate alternative forms of news production and citizen engagement that would either augment the efforts of the mainstream news media in African countries or, if need be, bypass the challenges they face. This argument sits well within current debates about the use and impact of ICTs on news consumption, journalistic practices, and the expansion of the public sphere. As many African countries still aspire towards functioning and modern democratic structures, there is a clear need for further academic discussion on, and empirical research into, this technology-led transformation of journalism. The connection of these challenges with the emancipation of the public sphere is evident, and thus we arrive at the questions this article addresses by drawing on published literature of both theoretical and empirical contexts, as well as the author's observations and research.

N2  - An emerging convergence is discernible in planning, governance and educational discourses towards place-based learning and participatory approaches in the pursuit of sustainable development (SD). Common themes include the development and application of strategies for facilitating multi-stakeholder learning communities to engage in collaborative learning, enquiry and action concerning issues of sustainability and global citizenship relevant to the home locality. The home locality is most often being formulated in terms of neighbourhood, city and/or regional scales since these represent identifiable and meaningful contexts within which social learning, participation and action can most readily be facilitated. The broad notion of ?learning communities, cities and regions for SD and global citizenship? can be seen as powerful formulation emerging from this convergence characterised by concepts, approaches and tools currently emerging at the interface between participatory approaches to local/regional planning, and place-based education for SD and involving the partnership of a range of ?learning stakeholders?. This article seeks to outline the nature and potential of these convergences. A number of pointers towards good practice and exemplars are also indicated, notably in terms of emerging Regional Centres for Excellence in Education for SD.

N2  - Positive discourse around social media and civic engagement inspired a neighborhood association with few members and resources to use these services. They hoped to revive the neighborhood association and attract new and younger members. They received five Facebook ?likes? and three Twitter followers out of 550 households. Survey results revealed a mismatch between perceptions of ?neighborly? and social media ties and expectations for neighborhood communication. However, residents most interested in the neighborhood association were those who chose social media for neighborhood outreach, not those choosing email or postal mail. Ultimately, using multiple communication methods is ideal, but targeting residents via social media might be a starting point for planners and resource poor organizations.

N2  - This case study builds on recent experimental research that sought to measure journalism-as-a-conversation, or co-created news between citizens and journalists, by overlaying it on The Seattle Times? 2010 Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage of the slayings of four sheriff?s deputies. Pulitzer jurors singled out that coverage for its smart use of Web tools to enhance audience engagement and the paper?s overall online presence without sacrificing accuracy. Findings suggest the growing power of such tools in breaking news and beyond, but also the need for less common but perhaps more humanizing efforts, including short, personalized videos of journalists stepping from behind the veil of objectivity to discuss how they do what they do.

N2  - In the classic study Little science, big science (New York: Columbia University Press, 1963), Derek Price traces the historical shift from what he calls little science?exemplified by early?modern ?invisible colleges? of scientific amateurs and enthusiasts engaged in small?scale, informal interactions and personal correspondence?to 20th?century big science, dominated by professional scientists and wealthy institutions, where scientific information (primarily in print form and its analogues) was mass?produced, marketed and circulated on a global scale. This article considers whether the growing use of more participatory, interactive ?Web 2.0? technologies and social media in science today (e.g. wikis, blogs, tagging and bookmarking, conferencing, etc.) may signal a revival of little science modes of communication that contrast with big science conventions that continue to dominate research policy, scientific institutions, and the publishing industry. A brief historical review of responses to the scientific ?information explosion? since the early 1900s is presented, with a particular focus on the idealization of large?scale, automated information systems and the privileging of formal (document?producing) over informal (interpersonal) modes of scientific communication. Alternative frameworks for scientific communication that incorporate both documents and interaction are used to examine contemporary examples of so?called Science 2.0 and citizen science projects to determine whether such projects indicate the emergence of new modes of communication in science that bridge the immediacy and involvement of invisible colleges and the rigor of peer?reviewed publishing. The implications for traditional documentary forms such as the journal article are also discussed.

N2  - This article, based on a computer-assisted analysis of Weibo communications about two recent ?mass incidents? in China, offers a model for understanding online communication's influence on government legitimacy. This study explores the discourse of Weibo discussions on social protests and what impacts this discourse may have on the legitimacy of Chinese government in the digital environment. The Weibo discourses on the two mass incidents suggest two modes of online communication: one-way communication, where local residents have taken the initiative and two-way communication, initiated by both local residents and national elites. Different themes the discourses have touched suggest different types and levels of impacts Weibo discussions have on government legitimacy. More precisely, the discourse in which there is a critique of the current national political system in China is more challenging to government legitimacy than the one in which there are only demands for local changes. The online discourse about the Haimen incident on Weibo even can be seen as reinforcing government legitimacy. Therefore, the impact of online communication on government legitimacy is relative and depends on specific cases. To understand the power of online communication requires us to analyse the nature of online discourses about specific cases and then examine them within external social and political contexts and by comparing them with one another. Contextual dynamics such as social problems and tensions can function as an indicator for understanding the type and level of impact of online communication on government legitimacy.

The museum embraced a plan to engage the community in selecting the design team and in the design process. Through a series of public presentations, online and in-house surveys, forums, focus groups and community collecting events, the museum actively sought public input on this landmark project. Additionally, the museum set ambitious goals for the renovated exhibitions to challenge visitors to consider their personal role in the ongoing work to create a more perfect union. This article discusses the strategies used to build community interest and support for the capital project and inform the development of new interpretive methods that would create emotionally stirring and accessible yet intellectually challenging exhibitions in the first museum dedicated to the interpretation of the American civil rights movement.

N2  - This paper addresses decision making process for emerging coordination in interorganizational collaborations during disasters. Lack of resources, decision making process, and poor communication are recurring problems for organizational performance in disaster operations. The aim of this study is to explore decision making during crisis through social networks. We hypothesize that the structural positions of organizations within interorganizational collaboration network have implications on the potential to coordinate leading to improved decision making in uncertain environments. To measure the structural positions of nodes, we consider three network attributes: ego-betweenness, degree centrality, and tie strength. A single qualitative survey question is used to measure coordination preparedness. We noticed that all three structural attributes have positive associations with coordination preparedness.
