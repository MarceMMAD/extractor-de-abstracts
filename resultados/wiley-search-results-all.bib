abstract = {Author's IntroductionWe wrote this paper because we felt there was a need for a more critical examination of the ways that media were considered within social psychology. The article was written to provide an overview of social psychological research on media and to propose new lines of enquiry, particularly into the social practices within which media technologies are embedded. In particular our arguments focus on the ways in which media permeate social life and relationships, and why we should give more attention to the study of media within the practices of everyday living. Media are pervasive in society today. Media are foundational to the symbolic landscape within which people make sense of the world and their place in it. Media also comprise material objects, such as televisions and computers that dominate many domestic realms, as well as more portable devices, such as mobile phones and MP3 players that people take with them when moving through everyday life. Human relations with and through media are complex and evolving, and provide a core focus for social psychology. In the living room of any modern home there are likely to be comfortable chairs, family memorabilia and a range of media technologies ranging from telephones, radios, books and magazines to a television, a DVD player, a digital recorder, iPod, and perhaps a networked computer. These devices are often mobile, and can be moved or relocated around the house, shifting from communal to more personal devices as family members seek privacy to consume their media products or react to different tastes in movie, musical or gaming content. Such practices open up a range of social psychological issues regarding human relations, identity, time and space. The presence of media devices in daily life has invoked concerns about the possible negative effects of exposure to media violence and broader issues around reduced civic participation, as well as more positively focused issues such as the use of media to build and maintain social ties.Many social psychologists have been preoccupied with issues of media effects, often viewed as negative, sometimes as pro-social. Others have worked to generate understandings of people's use of media in everyday life. This reveals a tension in the discipline around what the media does to individuals, and what people do with media. The emphasis in this teaching resource is on considering relationships and social practices surrounding media use in everyday life. This is not to deny that media use may have negative consequences in some instances. Rather, we want to temper the dominance of the traditional focus in psychology on negative media effects with a perspective that involves a broader consideration of social practices associated with media use in daily life. We consider some of the ways in which people engage with media and each other using communication technologies, and thereby promote a social psychology of media that attends to media-based practices as and where they occur.Author RecommendsWe have recommended readings from media and communications as well as from social psychology for this teaching resource, because a great deal of good theory and research relevant for social psychology is being conducted in the media and communications field as well as within social psychology.1. Silverstone, R. (1999). Why Study the Media? Sage: London.This book provides an accessible introduction to why it is important to study the media. Emphasis is placed on exploring the pervasive nature of media in everyday life and how media can captivate our attention in a variety of ways, as well as go virtually unnoticed. In emphasising the importance of media in this regard, Silverstone points to the need to avoid media-centricity – asserting media as an overdetermining influence on our understandings of social life and practices. Social psychologists need to consider how people use media to maintain interpersonal relations and to cope with tragic life events. Social psychologists also need to consider how powerful interests in society can also use media in an attempt to distract the public from the harsh political realities and social injustices.2. Giles, D. (2003). Media Psychology. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.This book provides an extensive engagement with the field of media psychology, issues around defining media and the extension of social psychological theories through media research. Giles opens up a space for beginning to consider how media are increasingly interlinked, and how content developed for television, newspapers, radio and magazines are increasingly mobilised for digital devices and computer networks. We can now watch our favourite soaps on the move and in fact re-edit television programmes for our own amusement. The concept of media convergence denotes the processes by which various media forms, such as computers, can now screen television programmes and films and can be used to download music. One can also read comic books online and download texts onto a mobile phone. Convergence also relates to media cross-fertilisation whereby a comic book character such as the hulk now appears in a movie, video game and his growl can be used as the ring tone on one's mobile phone.3. Couldry, N. (2004). Theorising media as practice. Social Semiotics, 14, 115–132.In recent years, media research has begun to build on the theoretical work of Nick Couldry and other media theorists to consider media as social practice. This involves a focus on how people integrate media technologies into their daily lives, rather than approaching media simply as an external influence. This turns attention to what is happening in public places and domestic settings as people engage in a range of social activities and relationships involving media technologies. Couldry notes that media does not simply enter everyday life, our homes, workplaces and social environments, but are created there. The meaning and role of the television set in the corner depends on what we do with it and the practices and relationships with which we surround it.4. García-Montes, J., Caballero-Muñoz, D., & Pérez-Álvarez, M. (2006). Changes in the self resulting from the use of mobile phones. Media, Culture & Society, 28 , 67–82.García-Montes, Caballero-Muñoz and Pérez-Álvarez provide an example of social psychological research into media practices surrounding the use of mobile phones. The use of these mobile communication devices has contributed to dissolving the separation between public and private spaces (receiving personal calls at work, or work calls during dinner in a restaurant). The use of phones requires users to negotiate the intersection or fusion of these spaces skilfully and also demands new forms of identity work. The mobile phone has consequences for how we live in time as well as space, and these researchers suggest that this technology has consequences for how we construct selves, with mobile phone use causing fragmentation (loss of the past as a context for current behaviour) and irresponsibility (loss of the future as a consequence for actions).5. Livingstone, S. (2007). On the material and the symbolic: Silverstone's double articulation of research traditions in new media studies. New Media & Society, 9, 16–24.Media devices are seldom used in isolation. Livingstone provides a useful overview of youth engagements with a range of media in domestic settings. These media range from landline and mobile phones, games, DVDs, to networked computers and social networking sights such as Facebook and Bebo. This article illustrates how media forms are not separable from one another, how these can saturate daily living and how media practices produce complex influences within everyday life. Livingstone shows the variety of social uses of media forms within domestic spaces – watching a DVD together or cohabitating in silence while plugged into iPods, and so on. A core issue is that media retexture domestic worlds to render spaces as simultaneously public and private, individual and shared. The complex use of media in domestic spaces should be of central interest to social psychologists because they provide insights into everyday environments and the social relations of everyday living.6. Silverstone, R. (2007) Media and Morality: On the Rise of the Mediapolis. Polity: Cambridge.This book explores how media provides shared spaces for engaging in collective practices through which identities can be nurtured and developed, belonging and participation can be fostered, supportive networks can be maintained and a sense of trust and belonging can be cultivated. Issues of symbolic power and whose versions of reality come to shape public discourse through media technologies are central to the book. Silverstone introduces the concept of the mediapolis to explain the presence of media in public life today. This involves an extension of the ancient Greek polis, the shared civic space where political communication occurred. The mediapolis extends this to the shared spaces provided by media technologies today.7. Hodgetts, D., Stolte, O., Chamberlain, K., Radley, A., Nikora, L., Nabalarua, E., & Groot, S. (2008). A trip to the library: Homelessness and social inclusion. Social and Cultural Geography, 9, 933–953.Continuing with the themes of civic engagement, the mediapolis, and the function of media in texturing physical space, Hodgetts and colleagues provide an example of how psychologists worked with journalists to ensure equitable access to public spaces for homeless people. This study explores a case involving negative news media representations of homeless men as a threat to others in a public library. The researchers worked directly with a journalist, providing access to alternative sources of information (the directors of major service agencies and homeless men), and on framing a feature article to provide a more positive view of the issue. This article discusses the capacity of news media journalists to pause and reflect on the ways in which events have been covered and people characterised, and to work differently, to provide a more civic-oriented journalism.Online Materials1. Media AdvocacyAny social psychology of the media needs to consider how research be used to promote public good. There are several web resources useful in this regard. Adbusters (http://www.adbusters.org) is a global network of media advocates who promote media education through the dissemination of satirical works designed to deconstruct and bring into question the norms of consumer and advertising culture. Further resources for information on media advocacy and useful resources include:http://www.marininstitute.org/action_packs/media_advocacy.htm andhttp://www.who.int/tobacco/policy/media_advocacy/en/2. Media Psychology (Division 46 of the American Psychological Association)This APA division, founded in 1985, collects together psychologists with an interest in media. It encompasses a diverse array of activity, including translating psychological research into assessable materials for public consumption, consulting with media producers on the production of educational materials (e.g. children's TV), hosting TV and radio shows, developing new communication technology and researching the effects of media on 'vulnerable' members of society. Students may like to visit the division's website: http://www.apa.org/divisions/div46, and explore the range of work being done by division members working with the media.3. PEW Internet ProjectThe Pew Internet and American Life Project is one of seven projects in the Pew Research Center (http://www.pewinternet.org/About-Us/About-the-Pew-Research-Center.aspx). This centre is a non-partisan 'fact tank' that seeks to provide information on issues, attitudes and trends shaping the United States of America and the world. It conducts public opinion polling and social science research, reports and analyses news coverage, and holds forums and briefings on a range of topics, but avoids taking positions on policy issues. Their reports, presentations and data sets, dating back to 2000, are all available for free. The Pew Internet Project investigates the social impact of the internet (see http://www.pewinternet.org) and contains a number of media reports about youth and media use. These materials are discussed next in terms of a sample syllabus for teaching the social psychology of the media.Lenhart, A., Kahne, J., Middaugh, E., Macgill, A., Evans, C., & Vitak, J. (2008). Teens, Video Games, and Civics. Washington, DC: PEW/Internet & American Life Project. Available at: http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2008/Teens-Video-Games-and-Civics.aspxLenhart, A., Madden, M., Macgill, A., & Smith, A. (2007). Teens and Social Media. Washington, DC: PEW/Internet & American Life Project. Available at: http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2007/Teens-and-Social-Media.aspxSample SyllabusThe article, along with the associated resources, is proposed for use as the basis for one or two lectures within an undergraduate course in social psychology, but could also be used as the basis for lectures and tutorials in courses on cultural or health psychology, providing a means to involve media in those areas. Rather than propose a whole social psychology syllabus, we suggest several lecture topics that could be developed around this reading and associated resources.A Possible LectureThe reading can be used as a basic structure for a lecture making key points as follows:
* • media are pervasive, complex and varied
* • the focus on media effects in social psychology is important but needs to be re-conceptualised
* • the limitations of existing approaches to media research in social psychology
* • loosing (and regaining) the social context
* • towards a critical social psychology of media.A second lecture could also focus on the role of media in shaping social practices around the inclusion and exclusion of groups in society. Such a lecture could draw on Chapter 10 from:Hodgetts, D., Drew, N., Stoltie, O., Sonn, C, Nikora, N., & Curtis, C. (2009). Social Psychology and Everyday Life. London: Palgrave/MacMillian.Alternative LectureThe rise of contemporary media continues to raise concerns in some circles regarding the ways in which increased media consumption may undermine traditional social and community ties. Media have been blamed for the demise of social life. Putman (2000) famously associated increased social isolation and a general decline in civic life with the rise of television, where viewing saps time that could be spent engaging 'productively' with fellow citizens. Social psychologists are increasingly considering the role of media in supporting or undermining public deliberations regarding community problems (Hodgetts et al., 2009). The lecture could explore how it is somewhat simplistic to maintain distinctions between reduced face-to-face community engagements and the rise of mediated communities, and to associate a supposed drop in civic life with increased media consumption. Psychologists have considered the ways in which public debates via media forums provide resources for face-to-face conversations where further considerations for issues can occur and courses of action be planned. This work is important because our daily talk regarding issues is often informed by media deliberations, which offer perspectives and resources for making sense of these issues. Research increasingly shows that media often provide spaces for a range of social practices, meetings and interactions beyond the world of virtual friends, movie characters and pop stars. We often watch television together, consuming sports events or concerts with friends and family (Silverstone, 2007). Media-based community activities stretch our meaningful social networks out beyond home locales.Puttman, D. (2000). Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Survival of American Community. New York: Simon and Schuster.A follow-up lecture or tutorial could explore these issues noted before in relation to the use of media by young people in relation to notions of civic participation. The session could draw upon two reports from the PEW Internet Project at: http://www.pewinternet.org/
* 1Lenhart, A., Madden, M., Macgill, A., & Smith, A. (2007). Teens and Social Media. Washington, DC: PEW/Internet & American Life Project. Available at: http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2007/Teens-and-Social-Media.aspxThe key issue explored in this report is how young people often conduct their social lives across online and offline worlds. Lenhart and colleagues found that US teens use media devices that they have at hand, be it landlines, mobile phones and/or computers, as well as engaging face-to-face. The participatory culture of youth created through the use of such devices transcends the online and offline divide. Lenhart and colleagues note that "…those [teens] who are the most active online with social media applications like blogging and social networking also tend to be the most involved with offline activities like sports, music, or part-time employment" (p. 9). These authors found that social networking and the creation of digital materials is central to the lives of many teenagers. The research showed that 93% of US teens aged 12–17 years participated in the internet, which has become an important landscape for social interaction and creating shared materials. Blogs, web pages and artistic creations were created by 64% of respondents, and 55% of these teens were present on social network sites such as Myspace and Facebook. Teens use these sites to maintain links with existing friends and family, to make plans for online and offline activities, and to meet new people. They also stay informed about social issues through producing or consuming and commenting on blogs.
* 2Lenhart, A., Kahne, J., Middaugh, E., Macgill, A., Evans, C., & Vitak, J. (2008). Teens, Video Games, and Civics. Washington, DC: PEW/Internet & American Life Project. Available at: http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2008/Teens-Video-Games-and-Civics.aspxAllaying the fears of some parents that their children's computer use will lead to social withdrawal, recent research associates internet use with increased civic participation. Lenhart and colleagues explored links between digital gaming and civic participation. Half the research participants reported playing games on the previous day, typically for an hour or more. Almost all (97%) youth played web, computer, consul, or portable games that included racing, puzzles, action, strategy and role-playing genres. A majority of these teens (65%) play with others in the same room and 27% with people linked via the internet. Many play with friends and family as well as with people met online. The authors found that aspects of game-playing have a positive relationship with civic outcomes, and include opportunities to simulate political activities, learning about governance, debate issues, forming and facilitating guilds or gaming groups (often globally) and helping others. Having to learn to cooperate and work as a member of a team to achieve shared objectives in many games can be associated with developing a skill set of relevance to the workplace and community life. Interest in games extends well beyond the consul with players also discussing game-playing both face-to-face and via the web. Further, youth kept in touch with friends while playing games over the web, and engage with each other at school regarding the intricacies of their gaming and associated conventions and groupings. To deprive children of time to game can be seen as a social isolating act.Focus Questions and ExercisesFocus Question 1Ask the class who plays digital games. Ask these students to pause for a moment and think about what their play involves; whether or not it involves aggression against victims, or engagements with scenarios and explorations of game worlds. Students should consider the following questions:
* • Are game players rehearsing to kill people?
* • How real are the characters in the games they play?
* • Do violent games contain opportunities to help one another?These are important questions that have not been taken up until recently in psychological studies of media effects. They invoke a social context and the broader motives and experiences of people who game. The exercise could also open up a discussion of how not all psychologists support the view that violent media content causes violent behaviour.Focus Question 2Students should be tasked with asking people they know about what impact media have on them:
* • Do those who consume violent media content see themselves as sociopaths ready to lay waste to those around them?
* • Does seeing images of young, fit, thin people make young women feel overweight or dissatisfied with their body shape?
* • Do media appeals for charitable giving produce strong levels of donating?A common response from many people is that media does not affect them personally, but that they are concerned about the effects on other people. This is commonly referred to as the third person effect. Read up on the third person effect (see Hodgetts et al., 2009).Focus Question 3Students should be asked to reflect on the communities they engage with via the media. These can involve interactions on social networking sites, the friends you text after class, shared reading of magazines of family viewings of television. Students may participate in 'imagined communities' when watching a national sports event. In reflecting on these communities, students should consider the following questions:
* • What is similar and different about these communities?
* • How do they relate to the conduct of your life online and offline?
* • Do your online and offline communities overlap sometimes while being distinct at other times?Seminar/Project IdeaProject 1With your slate and chalk, rock and chisel, or even on your computer, list all the media you use regularly (do not forget things such as packaging and billboards). As a class compare your lists with one other. Now compare your lists with those that would have been made by your grandparents when they were your age. In considering your lists, consider the following questions:
* • What trends do you see across these lists?
* • Where are media listed typically located?
* • What media are in your home and where are these situated?
* • Do people use different media in different ways in different places?The point of this exercise is to illustrate the pervasive nature of media and how, in recent decades, the presence of media in daily lives has proliferated. It is also to raise differences between people in media use. The exercise can be extended to a written assignment or a class presentation on the pervasiveness of media in everyday life.Project 2Students could be asked to locate a news or current affairs journalist for any media form (print, television, internet) and interview them about how they would research and write a story on a particular social psychology topic (bystander helping, drug-taking at a rock concert, a poor person being ejected from her housing, homeless people sleeping in parks, etc). Questions for the journalist should include how they would frame the story, what sources they would use to research the story, who would/should get quoted in the story, what values and ethics guide their work, pressures they face in producing news or current affairs stories and how much control they have over final content. Students should analyse the interview content and prepare a report or presentation that considers the degree to which their journalist understands and uses a civic journalism approach.},

abstract = {Recent communication research concerning participatory politics has found that the effects of media, especially campaign ads, conventional news, and online political resources, are largely mediated through interpersonal discussion about politics. This article extends this line of theorizing about the role of political conversation in citizen competence by testing an O-S-R-O-R model of campaign communication mediation, a modification and extension of the longstanding O-S-O-R model of communication effects. This model combines insights from iterations of the communication mediation model (McLeod et al., 2001; Shah et al., 2007) and cognitive mediation model (Eveland, 2001; Eveland, Shah, & Kwak, 2003) to theorize a set of the interrelated reasoning (R) processes that channel the influences of campaign exposure and news consumption on political engagement. Three key mediators of campaign and news influence are postulated: face-to-face political conversation, online political messaging, and cognitive reflection. We provide empirical evidence to test this model by merging two datasets: (1) tracking of the content and placement of campaign messages in the 2000 and 2004 election cycles, and (2) surveys of traditional and digital media consumption and levels of campaign participation during these same elections. Findings reveal that political conversation, political messaging, and cognitive reflection mediate the effects of campaign advertising exposure and news consumption on political participation and knowledge, providing considerable support for our theory. This O-S-R-O-R model helps organize a large body of theorizing and research on campaigns and conversation in the communication sciences.},

The digitally crowdsourced law for same-sex marriage was passed in Finland in 2014. Activists produced the draft text of the law on digital collaboration platforms, and support for the law was petitioned using strong digital identification. This article analyzes how the campaign for the Equal Marriage Law used new digital tools and created practices that affect democratic citizenship and power making. The campaigners succeeded in introducing to the national political debate the idea of a bill that had been twice rejected in the political process. This article introduces the typology of the mediating citizen to describe civic action that is able to affect representative politics in a constructive way and reprogram power. The radical legal framework, the Citizens' Initiative Act, offered a channel to pursue meaningful civic agency in Finland and counter the legitimacy crisis of representative democracies. In future efforts for enhancing digital civic participation such a channel for real impact should be part of the design.

Background
Over time, the notion of public has evolved. While the concept of public was initially conceived of as a single undifferentiated entity, the common understanding is now that a variety of differentiated, multifaceted and multiple public(s) can be constructed for different purposes. This is equally true in xenotransplantation; the literature shows how different kind of publics can be introduced as relevant. The paper explores the notion of public and the contemporary participatory procedures as participatory rights for citizens in decisions concerning technoscience and society. Its perspective, thus, is normative; namely, it aims at understanding how the political role of citizens is changing in democratic societies where matters of innovation are concerned. It is focused on xenotransplantation whose connections with public discourse and practices are quite paradigmatic among new emerging biomedical technologies, due to its peculiar risks.

Methods and results
The paper reviews the historical background of risk communication and public involvement in science-based decision-making and provides an overview of the current roles and meanings of deliberative procedures in xenotransplantation. After a short discussion of the history of the social implementation of xenotransplantation, the construction of the different publics dealing with this biomedical technology is briefly analysed. Publics have been firstly conceived of as objects of research, which has looked at them to quantify people's positive and negative attitudes towards xenotransplantation. Further developments have led to the notion of the public as composed of citizens, empowered as subjects of decisions. In both Canadian and Australian consultations, citizens were engaged in a complex learning process aimed at committing them to a decision. Despite the fact both public consultations represented important forms of experimental democracy, they were still focused on seeking consensus and assessing compliance from citizens. New Zealand is the most recent example of public consultation in xenotransplantation. Likewise, several public consultations have recently been launched by the European Commission on Advanced Therapies. Unlike in the Canadian and Australian cases, the latter initiatives aimed to reach only certain parts of the population, and the overall consultations were prepared to seek approval.

Conclusions
Several categories of individuals may be interesting and interested publics in xenotransplantation. This is a field in which the importance of the potential risks that xenotransplants pose to society has been widely discussed. The point is that publics should not only be educated about the risk but should be given an opportunity to participate actively in the decision about whether and under what conditions they are exposed to the risk. Likewise, the boundaries between surveys, consultations and collection of advice may be blurred in actual practices. The hope remains that all different instruments either to collect or disseminate knowledge, and to explore new tools of governance may help connect science and policy to society in deeper and more complex ways. The next step points to a different meaning of public participation. It is shifting from participation as mere consensus and risk acceptance, to public engagement as a form of shared responsibility for risk control and regulatory decision-making.

At the turn of the millennium, xenotransplantation was a topic with a high potential for societal dispute. The reasons were possible infection risks, necessary measures of risk management and surveillance, associated constraints of human rights as well as a number of various other ethical concerns. This situation prompted discussions about the governance of xenotransplantation on a national and international level. This paper compares international xenotransplantation policies and investigates patterns of policy-making as well as the different role of experts, policy-makers and the public therein.
Although it might be assumed that xenotransplantation was discussed globally in the same way, international comparison shows cultural contingency. First, although international organizations identified xenotransplantation as a global problem requiring broad public discussion, the intensity of public debates varied strongly among countries. Second, the topical framing of xenotransplantation differed between countries. Nevertheless, the problems of infection risk and organ shortage often dominated, whereas ethics and animal welfare issues were marginalized. Finally, xenotransplantation polices varied. In most cases regulation meant the decision to provide a legal framework to continue research, some countries took a wait and see position, and a minority opted for a legal or de-facto moratorium.
When comparing ways of policy-making, it is possible to discern different types of decision-making, i.e. bureaucratic, bureaucratic-technocratic, parliamentarian-political and participatory.
The bureaucratic type was elitist and closed; it limited decision-making to the civil service and handpicked internal experts. The bureaucratic-technocratic type was a bit more inclusive, but still, the role of the civil service was particularly strong. In addition, external experts – typically natural scientists and physicians, sometimes ethicists – were involved in advisory bodies. In a few cases, stakeholders and NGOs were also included to some degree. The parliamentarian-political type also included elected politicians in decision-making. Stakeholders and NGOs were only included as informants. The participatory type involved a very broad range of actors, i.e. civil servants, experts, elected politicians, NGOs, technology assessment organisations, and the general public.
Different types of policy-making used diverse approaches towards technology assessment (TA). Whereas in bureaucratic policy-making no formal TA processes were launched, the bureaucratic-technocratic type relied on expert TA. In the parliamentarian-political type, expert TA was complemented by the involvement of elected politicians. In the participatory approach, TA andparticipatory technology assessment (pTA) were used and attempts were made to link participation to politics.
The bureaucratic type of policy-making process was informed by workshops and conferences organized by international organizations, in which civil servants participated. In the bureaucratic-technocratic type, a broader range of information was used, stemming from experts or international organizations and early movers in xenotransplantation regulation. In the parliamentarian-political approach, in addition, stakeholders and NGOs provided information. Again, the participatory type used the broadest range of information, including international organizations, scientists, NGOs, and citizens.
The different types of policy-making involved the general public quite differently. The bureaucratic type neither involved, nor informed, the public. Similarly, the bureaucratic-technocratic approach involved the public only to a small degree. Citizens were included via survey research and information about results via the Internet. Also, the parliamentarian-political approach applied survey research and information; in one country, citizen involvement also meant consultation of selected actors. The participatory type used a range of activities to involve the public (e.g. citizen juries, consensus conferences, online debates, public discussion, theater plays). In Switzerland, several mechanisms of direct and representative democracy were utilized to initiate a debate.
The four approaches also differed in respect of accountability and openness. The bureaucratic, the bureaucratic-technocratic, and the parliamentarian-political approach had problems in one way or another and to different degrees regarding openness and accountability of recruitment, agenda setting, openness to the public, conflict of interest, and methods applied. The participatory approach, on the other hand, was open to the public, often gave ordinary citizens an opportunity to set an agenda, often recruited experts and citizens based on open call for tenders and explicit criteria, and used a broad variety of participatory methods.
In summary, comparison shows that in most cases the decision was taken to continue xenotransplantation research in principle. Most often processes of decision-making were bureaucratic-technocratic and – despite the rhetoric of public participation – rarely involved citizens. The processes were only open and accountable to a small degree and framed xenotransplantation rather narrowly in terms of organ shortage and risk. Thereafter, expert bodies rather quickly turned their focus on the concrete details of risk regulation and management.

abstract = {Author's introductionThis review of recent feminist analyses and theorizing of labor markets uses a global lens to reveal the forces shaping gender inequality. The first section introduces the key words of globalization, gender and work organization. Next, I examine gender as embodied labor activity in globalized worksites, and the effects of globalization on gendered patterns of work and life. Putting gender at the center of globalization discourses highlights the historical and cultural variability of gender relations intersecting with class, race and nationality, and highlights the impact of restructuring on workers, organizations and institutions at the local, national and regional as well as transnational levels. Then I turn to look at labor market restructuring through commodification of care, outsourcing of household tasks and informalization of employment to show how these processes shape the complexity of relationships between and the interconnectedness of social inequalities transnationally and in global cities. Place matters when analyzing how service employment alters divisions of labor and how these labor market changes are gendered. Global restructuring not only poses new challenges but also creates new opportunities for mobilization around a more robust notion of equality. The final section explores the development of spaces for collective action and the rise of new women's and feminist movements (e.g., transnational networks, non-governmental agencies). The study of globalization, gender and employment has broad importance for understanding not only the social causes but also the social consequences of the shift to a post-industrial society.Author recommendsAcker, Joan 2004. 'Gender, Capitalism and Globalization.'Critical Sociology 30, 1: 17–41.Feminist scholarship both critiques gender-blind globalization discourses and an older generation of women and development theories. By tracing the lineage of current feminist literature on globalization to women and development research, Joan Acker shows both the continuities and distance traveled from the previous terrain of debate. New feminist scholarship on globalization owes a debt to these important, albeit limited, studies of women at work in Latin America, Africa and Asia, but acknowledges the need to go beyond the category of women to analyze specific forms and cultural expressions of gendered power in relationship to class and other hierarchies. One of the major advances in feminist theory comes under the microscope of Acker's keen analysis when she excavates how gender is both embodied and embedded in the logic and structuring of globalizing capitalism. This extends the case she made in her earlier pioneering research on gender relations being embedded in the organization of major institutions. For the study of globalization, Acker posits that the gendered construction (and cultural coding) of capitalist production separated from human reproduction has resulted in subordination of women in both domains. Acker uncovers the historical legacy of a masculine-form of dominance associated with production in the money economy that was exported to and embedded in colonialist installation of large-scale institutions. By the late 20th Century large-scale institutions promoted images and emotions that expressed economic and political power in terms of new articulations of hegemonic masculinity. As an article outlining debates on the nature of globalization and of gender, it serves as a good introduction to the topic.Chow, Esther Ngan-Ling 2003. 'Gender Matters: Studying Globalization and Social Change in the 21st Century.'International Sociology 18, 3: 443–460.Chow's introduction to the special issue on 'Gender, Globalization and Social Change in the 21st Century' in International Sociology (2003) reviews the literature on gender and globalization and provides an excellent overview of 'gender matters.' Her definition of globalization captures salient features of the current era. This definition encompasses the economic, political cultural and social dimensions of globalization. Further, she offers a framework for studying the 'dialectics of globalization', as 'results of conflicting interaction between the global and local political economies and socio-cultural conditions…' A dialectics of globalization is a fruitful approach for studying transformative possibilities. This article could serve as background reading or as part of an introductory section.Arlie Russell Hochschild, Arlie Russell. 2003. 'Love and Gold.' Pp. 15–30 in Global Women: Nannies, Maids and Sex Workers in the New Economy, edited by Barbara Ehrenreich and Arlie Russell Hochschild. Metropolitan Books.Hochschild's chapter in Global Women examines the transfer of traditional women's work to migrant women. Women in rich countries are turning over care work (nannies, maids, elder care) to female migrant workers who can be paid lower wages with few or no benefits and minimal legal protections. This global transfer of services associated with a wife's traditional role extracts a different kind of labor than in prior migrations based on agricultural and industrial production. Emotional, sexual as well as physical labor is extracted in this current phase of globalization; in particular, emotional labor and 'love is the new gold'. Women migrate not only to escape poverty, but also to escape patriarchy in their home countries by earning an independent income and by physical autonomy from patriarchal obligations and expectations. Many female migrants who leave poor countries can earn more money as nannies and maids in the First World than in occupations (nurses, teachers, clerical workers) if they remained in their own country. Thus, migration can be seen as having contradictory effects on women's well-being and autonomy. This chapter can be used in a section dealing with the specific topic of globalization and care work or in a section introducing the topic of gendered labor activities.McDowell, Linda, Diane Perrons, Colette Fagan, Kath Ray and Kevin Ward. 2005. 'The Contradictions and Intersections of Class and Gender in a Global City: Placing Working Women's Lives on the Research Agenda.'Environment and Planning A 37, 441–461.This group of prominent social geographers from the UK collaborates to great effect in a welcome addition to the literature theorizing the complex articulations of gender and class in global cities. Their detailed research comparing three localities in Greater London is a corrective to the oft-cited multi-site study of global cities by Saskia Sassen. They find that Sassen underestimates gains and losses for both men and women in the 'new' economy. Place makes a difference when assessing the impact of women's increased rates of labor market participation on income inequality and patterns of childcare. The article outlines a new research agenda by 'placing' working women's lives at the center of analysis.Parrenas, Rhacel Salazar 2008. The Force of Domesticity: Filipina Migrants and Globalization. New York: New York University Press.Rhacel Salazar Parrenas brings together her influential research on Filipina migrants and extends her path-breaking ethnographic analysis to include Filipina domestic workers in Rome and Los Angeles and entertainers in Tokyo. David Eng incisively captures the importance of Parrenas's analysis when he states, 'Extracted from home and homeland only to be reinserted into the domestic spaces of the global north, these servants of globalization exemplify an ever-increasing international gendered division of labor, one compelling us to reexamine the neo-liberal coupling of freedom and opportunity with mobility and migration'. The book is well suited to illuminate discussions of domesticity and migration, transnational migrant families, the impact of migration laws in 'home' and 'host' countries, and transnational movements among migrant women.Walby, Sylvia. 2009. Globalization and Inequalities: Complexity and Contested Modernities. London: Sage.This book introduces new theoretical concepts and tests alternative hypotheses to explain variation in trajectories of gender relations cross-nationally. It synthesizes and reviews a vast literature, ranging from the social sciences to the natural sciences to construct a new approach to theorizing the development of gender regimes in comparative perspective. Sylvia Walby seeks to explain the different patterns of inequalities across a large number of countries. The analysis differentiates between neo-liberal and social democratic varieties of political economy, and makes explicit the gender component of institutions and their consequences. The project builds on Walby's pioneering work on comparative gender regimes, and extends the research by operationalizing empirical indicators for a range of key concepts, and by analyzing links between a wide set of institutions (including economy, polity, education and violence) and how these are gendered in specific ways. As in the past, Walby is not afraid to tackle big questions and to offer new answers. Throughout the book, like in her previous body of research, Walby takes on the question of social inclusion/exclusion and critically interrogates concepts of democracy, political participation, equality and rights. Walby uses a comparative lens to examine the democratic 'deficit' in liberal and social democratic countries, and how migration restructures patterns of inequality and the consequent reconstitution of national and ethnic relations within countries. There is more to the book than abstract theoretical debates. Walby poses and assesses alternative political projects for achieving equality. The book is an original contribution that will likely influence sociology in general and theories of social change in particular.Online resourcesStatus of women in the world: United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) http://www.unifem.orgUNIFEM was established at the United Nations in order to foster women's empowerment through innovative programs and strategies. Its mission statement summarizes UNIFEM's goals as follows: 'Placing the advancement of women's human rights at the center of all of its efforts, UNIFEM focuses on reducing feminized poverty, ending violence against women; reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS among women and girls; and achieving gender equality in democratic governance in times of peace as well as war'. The website includes information on global initiatives such as zero tolerance of violence against women, the impact of the economic crisis on women migrant workers, and strategizing for gender proportionate representation in Nigeria. Primary documents relevant to women's advancement appear on the website; these include the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and the UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security. UNIFEM publishes monographs assessing the progress of women around the world. One notable example is the 2005 publication on Women, Work & Poverty by Martha Chen, Joann Vanek, Francie Lund, James Heintz with Renana Jhabvala and Christine Bonner.http://www.unifem.org/attachments/products/PoWW2005_eng.pdfGender equity indexhttp://www.socialwatch.org/en/avancesyRetrocesos/IEG_2008/tablas/valoresdelIEG2008.htmSocial Watch produces an up-to-date gender equity index composed of three dimensions and indicators: empowerment (% of women in technical positions, % of women in management and government positions, % of women in parliaments, % of women in ministerial posts); economic activity (income gap, activity rate gap); and education (literacy rate gap, primary school enrollment rate gap, secondary school enrollment gap, and tertiary education enrollment gap). These separate indicators in addition to the gender equity index are arrayed by country. There are 157 countries, representing 94% of the world's population, in the sample. Mapping these indicators across countries presents a comparative picture of the absolute and relative standing of women and gender equity in the world.Focus QuestionsKey words: Globalization1.

This article presents an experimental model for citizen deliberation that bridges the gap between developments in normative deliberative theory, and online participation and deliberation in practice. The Social Web for Inclusive and Transparent democracy (SOWIT) model is designed for integration into policy-making processes. It is currently being developed in consultation with citizens, civil society organizations, and Councilors in an Irish local authority and will be implemented in 2014. Our approach is rooted in Dryzek and Niemeyer's (Dryzek and Niemeyer [2008]. American Political Science Review 102(4): 481–93) innovations in discursive representation and meta-consensus as well as Bächtiger et al.'s (Bächtiger et al. [2010]. Journal of Political Philosophy 18: 32–63) sequential approach to deliberation. SOWIT pioneers a dynamic implementation of a meta-consensus framework for structuring and incentivizing policy deliberations. In this article, we present the model, explain its normative rationale, and outline the experimental framework.

Many have forgotten that dictators in the past had already used democracy to establish their iron grip. Hitler seized power in a democratic context, however, unique and peculiar may we judge Weimar Germany from today's standards. Over 50 years later, Milosevic's ascent to power in Serbia was confirmed within an electoral democratic framework. More recently, populist autocrats like Italy's PM Silvio Berlusconi, Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and some Latin American leaders have thrived on majoritarian democratic principles, treating electoral results as vox populi vox dei while manipulating popular emotions through patriotic appeals.However, an increasing number of authors share a disenchanted view of liberal democracy, stressing its incapacity to bring durable peace and granting human co-existence. This trend can be called 'demo-skepticism' and should not be confused with 'anti-democratic' thought. 'Demo-skeptics' stress in particular democracy's incapacity to regulate and rein in nationalism. Michael Man's milestone work on the Dark Side of Democracy demonstrates how majority rule can lead to the explosion of ethnic cleansing and genocide.In line with Mann's argument, majoritarian democracies as political systems do not often take into account minority aspirations and identities. In such a context, the rule of the dominant ethnonational majority remains unchallenged on most grounds. Obsessed by fear of difference, many majoritarian democracies have been historically unable to deal with ethnic, cultural and religious pluralism – depending on which of these bases a majority group is defined. Moreover, majoritarian democracies are often opposed, or suspicious about, multiculturalism.Over the past two centuries, this has led to self-defeating policies of cultural assimilation, predicated on a vision of cultural homogeneity, which eventually led to physical eliminationism and genocide in a context of international war. Therefore, we can identify a link between cultural homogenization, intolerance and, eventually, the degeneration of democracy.Finally, liberal democracy both in its majoritarian and in its multicultural variety, can be charged with having encouraged, rather than simply adapted to, globalization, with all its harrowing consequences. The litmus test for contemporary democracy will probably be its capacity to tackle climate change catastrophe and survive intact (http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/politics/comparativePolitics/Nationalism/?view=usaeci=9780199228232.Annotated readings:Michael Man 2005. The Dark Side of Democracy. Explaining Ethnic Cleansing. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.This book provocatively argues that Western-style modern democracy lies at the heart of the worst tragedy of the 20th century, genocide: for man, the most horrific instances of ethnic cleansing, from the Armenian genocide to the Holocaust and the Rwandan massacres, have their roots in the increasing participation of demographic majorities into representative politics. The American Constitution's opening salvo, 'We are the people', lends itself to two opposite interpretations: one ethnic, the other civic. The 'people' can be either the ethnos, sharing putative descent, or the demos, sharing citizenship and hypothetical equal rights, irrespective of their descent. However, in a settler society built on pillage, destruction, and where the clearing of the conquered lands of its original inhabitants was legitimized in God's name, the ethnic variety tended to prevail, imbued with legalistic and ideological justifications. In fact, some of the worst instances of genocides occurred in settler societies, where invaders (white European settlers) used their immense technological superiority to subdue entire populations in order to seize land and resources.Things radically changed with Westernizing modernity and the rest of the book is entirely dedicated to the 20th century. The Armenian genocide in Turkey is recognized as the precursor of modern genocides. During the collapse of the Ottoman empire, state structures modernized and westernized rapidly and non-Muslims became suddenly exposed to the demise of Ottoman liberal consociational laws (pp. 62 and 114–119). The Nazi Holocaust is identified as the most premeditated and state-centered of genocides (p. 201). But the 'final solution' could only be carried out under war circumstances, during which escalation was justified as 'self-defense'. The most extreme forms of totalitarian mass murder in human history were carried out under 'socialist' dictatorships: Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot exterminated much greater proportions of their own people than any nationalist regimes. Rwanda fully substantiates the book's core argument: Hutu genocidal leaders always spoke in the name of majoritarian democracy against Tutsi 'invaders' (p. 443). Indeed, as in most 'developmental' genocides, minorities (in this case, the Tutsis) were marked as 'obstacles' to development and 'progress'. Appeals to mass 'democracy' were channeled through populist manipulation leading to 'democratic genocide' (if such as notion is at all acceptable).Mann convincingly demonstrates that western did not offer salvation. His use of the concept of democracy is limited to majoritarianism or 'majority rule'– hence the concern with the tyranny of the majority. Ethnic cleansing is thus linked to a plebiscitarian form of representative government as emerged with the Western nation-state system. Indeed, his book might more aptly be re-named the 'Dark side of Nation-statism'. Neither the modern nation-state, nor Anglo-Saxon communitarianism did contemplate an extension of democratic rights beyond the narrow boundaries of the dominant ethnos, he claims.Special issue of the Political Studies Review, Volume 4 Issue 3, pp. 247–395 (September 2006), http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118625374/issue.

Nationalist Exclusion and Ethnic Conflict: Shadows of Modernity. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. The book explores the consequences of the shift from a pre-modern, multicultural to a modern, nationalized world, with its obsession with 'national' security, homogeneity and unity. The age of empires, particularly the Ottoman Empire, is taken as evidence of an era where inter-ethnic tolerance was the norm, rather than the exception. State nationalism is recognized as a deeply exclusionary boundary-building process, leading to the destruction of collective memory, ancient communities and patterns of coexistence.http://cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521812550Joshua Fishman 1997.

Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press. This is the text that, with Taylor's, launched the debate on multiculturalism. It is now a classic. Combining institutional analysis and normative political theory from the viewpoint of liberal philosophy, the book espouses a strong argument in support of collective minority rights, including cultural rights in the broader sense. As no single formula can be applied to all groups, the author sets to explore different possible types of multicultural citizenship consistent with the principles of liberal democracy.http://www.us.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/PoliticalTheory/PoliticalPhilosophy/?view=usa&ci=9780198290919Go to Will Kymlicka's homepage: http://post.queensu.ca/~kymlicka/Charles Taylor 1994.

The other key text on multiculturalism, by another Canadian political philosopher (see above).

The book is wholly devoted to Taylor's essay on recognition, with responses by eminent philosophers and other scholars from Canada and elsewhere.http://www.amazon.com/Multiculturalism-Examining-Recognition-Charles-Taylor/dp/0691037795AD Smith Nationalism and Modernism. London/New York: Routledge, 1998. Originally published as Theories of Nationalism in 1971, this is an entirely revised and updated discussion of the most influential theories in the field. It is the classic reference text for those who want to explore the most recent debates in the field. Two main oppositions are identified: on the one side, the one between modernism (nations as products of modernity) and perennialism (nations long-predating modernity); on the other side, between primordialism (nations as 'given') and instrumentalism (nations as a product of elites' manipulation).http://www.routledgepolitics.com/books/Nationalism-and-Modernism-isbn9780415063418Connor, Walker 2004.

This is possibly the most important, condensed and cogent essay written by Connor (http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/conversi/legitimacy.pdf).David D. Laitin 2007. Nations, States, and Violence. Oxford: Oxford University Press: Oxford, 162 pp.From a rational-choice perspective, Laitin demonstrates that cultural heterogeneity is not inherently conducive to violent conflict. It is rather the contrary attempt to force homogeneity upon diverse populations that can set off civic strife and even wars. To start with, one cannot find a statistically significant correlation between cultural diversity and ethnic conflict. Neither ethnic nor cultural differences can in themselves spur mass violence and civil war. However, from a more econo-centric angle, Laitin also considers cases in which cultural/linguistic heterogeneity can be negatively correlated to the effective provision and consumption of public goods, turning into a catalyst of conflict. Laitin argues that the homogenizing nation-state is on its way to decline, most often without even ever having served its original purpose of creating cohesive, unified communities under the control of strong central governments. As the pervasiveness of governmental control overs its own citizens is now more capillary and potent than ever, ethnicizing states are no longer affordable, secure and viable and one can imagine the consequences of patriots and ethnic lobbies grabbing the levers of powers anywhere (we had a chilling warning after 9/11).The centrality of liberal-democratic institutions in the management of ethno-cultural diversity is not disputed. Indeed, Laitin proposes both institutional recognition and a fuller democratization of ethnic politics; in other words, integration without assimilation. Although a strong state can prevent ethnic conflict, its strength can also be measured by its unwillingness to embark upon self-defeating assimilations projects. In other words, a strong state must by definition be committed to the practice of full-spectrum multiculturalism.Online materialsNationalism Project (http://www.nationalismproject.org)Asen (http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/ASEN/)Just Democracy (http://www.justdemocracyblog.org/)Just WarTheory (http://www.justwartheory.com/)Will Kymlicka's homepage (http://post.queensu.ca/~kymlicka/)Sociology Lens (http://sociologycompass.wordpress.com/?s=democracy)Crisis Forum - Forum for the stucly of crisis in the 21st century (http://www.crisis-forum.org.uk/)BlogsNationalism Blog (http://nationalismblog.com/), in conjunction with the Nationalism Project above.Strongdemocracy/democracybytes (http://blog.civworld.orgl).

Then identify possible solutions and strategies of conflict management and regulation. In all cases, see whether liberal institution–building and the enshrining of human rights (including social rights but not ethnic specific) can have a positive impact during transitional phases of democratization.Alternatively discuss whether democracy can exist without freedom of expression, particularly in the media. In which countries, does media monopoly (or actual/de facto censorship) turn democracy into an empty word? Also, explore the connection between censorship, public manipulation and populist patriotism: How easily can patriotism be abused by political elites in conditions of information deficit? that is, when critical information is unavailable?Finally, move these questions into the future and relate them to predictions about climate change. Imagine how climate change will eventually affect democratic practices – try to imagine the ways in which this can happen, particularly in reference to mass migrations, cultural destruction, boundary-building, and conflict over dwindling resources. Will the global emergency exasperate already existing ethno-national conflicts propping up new and more aggressive forms of censorship through nationalism and patriotism? Will nationalism and war plunge the world into further chaos? Or rather will the new global crisis encourage states and elites to collaborate? Will it provide an opportunity to build vast supranational coordination efforts, establishing thus some form of cosmopolitan governance?},

Hughey, 'The Janus Face of Whiteness: Toward a Cultural Sociology of White Nationalism and White Antiracism', Sociology Compass 3/6 (2009): 920–936, 10.1111/j.1751-9020.2009.00244.xAuthor's introductionOver the past 20 years, the study of white racial identity has received in-depth, interdisciplinary attention. Under sociological scrutiny, the study of whiteness has traversed quite a few stages: from understandings of whiteness as a category replete with social privileges, as a mere reflection of non-racial (often class-based) dynamics, to its most recent turn that emphasizes the contextual and intersectional heterogeneity of whiteness. Because of the increased attention to context and political disputes, the study of whiteness has never been more amenable to cultural analysis than it is today. Hence, an emphasis on different white racial formations that span a political spectrum – from conservative to liberal and racist to antiracist – is now dominant. In this vein, white nationalists and white antiracists represent the distinct polarities of contemporary inquisitions into white racial identity. Motivated by this academic milieu, this guide offers an overview of the major scholarship that address white nationalism & white antiracism, appropriate online materials, and examples from a sample syllabus. Together, these resources aim to assist in understanding the general processes and contexts that produce 'whiteness' and imbue it with meaning, the social relationships and practices in which white racial identity identities become embedded, and how whiteness simultaneously possesses material and symbolic privileges alongside diverse and seemingly antagonistic experiences.Author recommendsThe complexity of whitenessMcDermott, Monica and Frank L. Samson 2005. 'White Racial and Ethnic Identity in the United States.'Annual Review of Sociology 31: 245–61.Any contemporary apprentice of the sociological study of white racial identity should read this essay. Monica McDermott and her student Frank Samson combine to provide a robust overview of the literature. They walk the tightrope of balancing both a broad coverage of the literature with the depth that key studies necessitate. In so doing, they put a finger on the key dilemma of studying white racial identity today: 'Navigating between the long-term staying power of white privilege and the multifarious manifestations of the experience of whiteness remains the task of the next era of research on white racial and ethnic identity' (2005: 256).Duster, Troy 2001. 'The 'Morphing' Properties of Whiteness.' Pp. 113–33 in The Making and Unmaking of Whiteness, edited by E. B. Rasmussen, E. Klinenberg, I. J. Nexica and M. Wray. Durham, NC: Duke University Press.In this essay – part of a larger volume on whiteness that I also recommend – Duster synthesizes disparate approaches to the study of whiteness. Demonstrating how some scholars understand white racial identity as a contextual and cognitive category ('fluid'), while some frame whiteness as a structural and fixed category of material privileges ('frozen'), Duster asks 'who is right?' He answers via the metaphor of whiteness-as-water. In one moment, whiteness can morph into vapor as a contextual and unstable identity, while the next moment it can instantly transform into a harsh and unyielding form of ice-like privilege. Duster's essay is an excellent retort for those who argue that we should move 'beyond' race to the utopian realm of color-blind individualism. Duster demonstrates, although the example of the supposedly egalitarian New Deal, that while race is socially constructed, the legacy of racism remains a historically reproduced and real social fact – denying the existence of race perpetuates racial inequality. Duster closes the chapter with a personal anecdote that grounds the historical example in modern, interactional, and everyday life.Perry, Pamela 2002. Shades of White: White Kids and Racial Identities in High School. Durham, NC: Duke University Press.Perry gives us two ethnographic studies in one – that of two northern California high schools: one located in a predominantly white, if economically diverse, suburb, the other situated in a multiracial urban community. Perry persistently and systematically probes the complexities of white racial identity in the practices and discourses of the youth attending these high schools. She finds that whites in the predominantly white, suburban high school do not see themselves as a unique race and take their racial identity for granted – they understand distinctly white practices as normative rather than as constitutive of a subjective worldview. In contrast, the whites at the multiracial, urban high school possess a more critical and comparative view of race and their own place in the racial order. In sum, Perry argues that whiteness is a set of complex, contradictory, and multiple subject positions.Wray, Matt. 2006. Not Quite White: White Trash and the Boundaries of Whiteness. Durham, NC: Duke University Press.Matt Wray brings the tools of cultural sociology viz-á-viz'symbolic boundaries' to the interrogation of the moniker White Trash. Wray problematizes this relatively normalized term to question its origins and how it persists. Drawing upon literary texts, folklore, diaries, medical articles, and social scientific analyses from the early 1700s to the turn of the 20th century, Wray documents the multiple meanings that were projected onto poor rural whites in the United States. Of particular import, Wray demonstrates how white supremacist ideas about class and region became dominant through public health campaigns and eugenic reformations. Impoverished whites found themselves the targets of officials and activists who framed them as 'filthy' or "feebleminded," and thus a threat to the purity and supremacy of the white race. This text is particularly informative for its demonstration of how white supremacist logic was not only focused on racial 'otherness' but used the axes of class and location to directly demarcate and attack those seen as 'white' yet somehow racially deficient and unworthy.Winant, Howard 2004. 'Behind Blue Eyes: Whiteness and Contemporary U.S. Racial Politics.' Pp. 3–16 in Off White: Readings on Race, Power, and Society, edited by Michelle Fine, Lois Weis, Linda C. Powell and April Burns. New York, NY: Routledge.In applying his now classic approach formulated in concert with Michael Omi (Racial Formations, 1986), Howard Winant applies the 'racial projects' thesis to whites: 'I think it would be beneficial to attempt to sort out alternative conceptions of whiteness, along with the politics that both flow from and inform these conceptions. … focusing on five key racial projects, which I term, far right, new right, neoconservative, neoliberal, and new abolitionist' (2004: 6). Hence, Winant maps a theory of white identity formation onto a bifurcated 'culture war.' Labeling this phenomenon 'racial dualism as politics,' Winant advances a paradigm in which whiteness is undergoing 'a profound political crisis.' Winant's essay is especially important for those that wish to emphasize the heterogeneity of white racial identity, as he provides Weberian-like 'ideal types' for the comprehension of the racial-political landscape.Hughey, Matthew W. (forthcoming 2010). 'Navigating the (Dis)similarities of White Racial Identities: The Conceptual Framework of "Hegemonic Whiteness."'Ethnic & Racial Studies.In this work, I build upon many of the aforementioned studies. Like Pamela Perry (2002) I dive into two ethnographic sites, but of much different breed. To interrogate how whiteness might be akin to 'vapor and ice' (Duster 2001) and to provide a robust answer to the dilemma of the 'long-term staying power of white privilege' (McDermott and Samson 2005) alongside the 'political crisis' of whiteness (Winant 2004), I studied a white nationalist and white antiracist organization. Combining over fourteen months of field observations, in-depth interviews, and content analysis of documents, I found that the varied political and overt ideological orientations of both groups masked striking similarities in how both groups made meaning of whiteness. In particular, these similarities were guided by a collective reliance on reactionary, racist, and essentialist scripts, latent worldviews – and like Wray (2006) – symbolic boundaries. The realization that there remains a shared 'groupness' to outwardly different white identities has the potential to destabilize the recent trend that over-emphasizes white heterogeneity at the expense of discussion of power, racism, and discrimination. As a resolution to this analytic dilemma, this article advances a conceptual framework entitled 'hegemonic whiteness.' In this model, white racial identity formation is understood as an ongoing process in which (1) racist, reactionary, and essentialist ideologies are used to demarcate inter-racial boundaries and (2) performances of white racial identity that fail to meet those ideals are marginalized and stigmatized, thereby creating intra-racial distinctions within the category 'white.'White supremacy & nationalismDobratz, Betty A. and Stephanie L. Shanks-Meile 1997. The White Separatist Movement in the United States: 'White Power, White Pride!' Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press.This is a good place to begin with the study of the white separatist, nationalist, and supremacist movements in the United States. The book is primarily descriptive and quickly debunks the stereotype that the movement is tied to an uneducated and Southern cadre of disenfranchised men. The authors interviewed more than 125 white separatists, attended white power rallies and other white separatist meetings, and examined much of the movement-generated literature. A major strength of the text is the demonstration of key divisions within the white supremacist movement, most notably religious ideology and views toward gender. However, this high note is often bookended by their overdependence on journalistic-like description rather than sociological explanation.Zeskind, Leonard. 2009. Blood and Politics: The History of the White Nationalist Movement from the Margins to the Mainstream. New York, NY: Farrar Straus Giroux.This book is a critical companion to Dobratz and Shanks-Meile (1997). Beginning in the 1950s and taking the reader into the contemporary moment, the text affords a sprawling account of the shifting currents in white nationalism. In both meticulous detail and incredible breadth, the 645-page tome was composed from Zeskind's 15-year-long research of the white nationalist movement – describing in detail how the movement has somewhat successfully moved from the shadows of a stigmatized racist identity to wear the mask of a more 'button-down' and gentile white nationalism.Ferber, Abby L. 1998. White Man Falling: Race, Gender, and White Supremacy. Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc.Abby Ferber does an excellent job of illuminating white nationalist publications like White Patriot and White Power to clarify not only the racial, but the intersectional weltanschauung of white male nationalists. In so doing, Ferber demonstrates how the concept of 'race' has evolved alongside the development of the white supremacist and nationalist movements. Ferber's empirically based critique unpacks the still-growing ideological assertion that white men are now the quintessential victims of the social order, and she convincingly demonstrates the repercussions of their attempts to re-assert white male power. I would be remiss if I did not also point the reader to her follow-up study: Home-Grown Hate: Gender and Organized Racism (New York, NY: Routledge, 2004). Other notable mentions in this vein include Kathleen Blee's Inside Organized Racism: Women in the Hate Movement (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 2002) and Jessie Daniels'White Lies: Race, Class, Gender, and Sexuality in White Supremacist Discourse (New York, NY: Routledge, 1997).Berbrier, Mitch 2000. 'The Victim Ideology of White Supremacists and White Separatists in the United States.'Sociological Focus 33: 174–91.In much the same vein as Ferber, Mitch Berbrier demonstrates how white victimization ideologies are a growing, but not yet central, facet of white supremacist and separatist organizing. Rather, discourses of racial victimization are put to the service of larger concerns in white supremacist activism: for example, either to activate a sense of urgency in the perceived loss of white racial pride and self-esteem, or to convince outsiders (and potential members) that they are living in time of white 'genocide.' I also recommend Berbrier's 1998 Social Problems article entitled '"Half the Battle": Cultural Resonance, Framing Processes, and Ethnic Affectations in Contemporary White Separatist Rhetoric.'White antiracismBonnett, Alastair 2000. Anti-Racism. London and New York, NY: Routledge.This is a valuable text for those wishing to understand both the historical trajectory of, and current variation within, the antiracist movement. Bonnett first traces anti-racism's philosophical historicity through thinkers such as Comte, Montaigne, and Du Bois. After delineating the theoretical underpinnings of the movement, Bonnett then outlines the spatial variation of antiracism to uncover the networked relationships between Brazil, China, France, the US, and the UK, to name just a few examples. In this vein, while the text does not explicitly focus on white anti-racism, a large portion of the book directly challenges the dominance of the Eurocentric variations of anti-racism, as it even briefly surveys the outgrowths of anti-racism in the form of multiculturalism, anti-Nazi/anti-fascist movements, and the 'local' activist organizations that purport to represent marginalized communities. While the book takes on a large subject matter, its relatively small size often falls short of giving each subject the attention it deserves. Still, the book serves as an excellent overview.Apthecker, Herbert 1993. Anti-Racism in U.S. History: The First Two Hundred Years. Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers.Like Bonnett's text (2000), this book does not explicitly center on white antiracism, but much of the examples used by the late Marxist historian are drawn from white abolitionists and activists. In fact, recovering the lost history of whites whom rejected racist rationales for the 'peculiar institution' of slavery and in turn, evidenced a remarkable degree of racial egalitarianism, appears the impetus for Aptheker's decision to compose the book. Overall, the text remains a tour de force of the pervasiveness of both white racism and its white resistance, as it covers the intersection of racism, sexuality, labor, the political ideologies of Grégoire, Banneker, & Jefferson, religion, the effects of the civil war, and emancipation.Srivastava, Sarita 2005. '"You're Calling me a Racist?" The Moral and Emotional Regulation of Antiracism and Feminism.'Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society 31(1): 29–62.This article demonstrates how the dominant practices and discourses of emotional expression shape antiracist debates over what constitutes a proper antiracist approach. By showing how the predominant mode of discussion in many antiracist organizations is hinged to the disclosure of personal experiences and emotion, Srivastrava demonstrates that this mode constricts the ability to produce organizational or structural change. Accordingly, white antiracist discussion groups often devolve into a setting in which the focus shifts from fighting racism to that of quelling the emotional turbulence of white participants – a pattern that unintentionally reestablishes a focus on white well-being and privilege.Niemonen, Jack June 2007. 'Antiracist Education in Theory and Practice: A Critical Assessment.'The American Sociologist 38(2): 159–77.With critical aplomb, Jack Niemonen interrogates the pedagogical, curricular, and organizational claims of 'antiracist education'– an endeavor largely tied to liberal, white, and 'multicultural advocates.' Operationalized through a study of approximately 160 papers recently published in peer-reviewed journals, Niemonen finds that the dominant forms of 'antiracist education' are far from sociologically grounded, empirically based accounts of the significance of race, but 'embodies the confessional and redemptive modes common in evangelical Protestantism' (164). Picking up on a key contradiction endemic to a large percentage of white antiracist literature, whites are often framed as 'inherently racist' yet are prodded to constantly seek paths to redemption and salvation. Informing my own work, Niemonen demonstrates how antiracist educators often employ a myopic and reductionist 'culture war' view of the world in which battle lines are drawn between the 'good and bad' whites. Aside from the fact that Niemonen's scathing critique sometimes borders on a kind of evangelicalism in its own right, his overview of the literature does afford the prescient observation that a great deal of antiracist activism is built on abstract moralism rather than sociological empiricism.O'Brien, Eileen 2001. Whites Confront Racism: Antiracists and Their Paths to Action. New York, NY: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc.O'Brien's work is a survey of white antiracist activists from across North America. The book is a nice counterpoint to Niemonen's (2007) findings, as O'Brien finds that many white antiracists are quite savvy in their ability to avoid the typical options of 'being a nonracist' or devolving into emotional turmoil associated with 'white guilt'; many of the whites demonstrate large variation in how they combat modern racism. Of import, O'Brien shows that these whites' affiliations with antiracist organizations – and even their lack thereof – can play a crucial role in their approach to their antiracist activism. As such, O'Brien shows that a more critical white antiracist approach is evolving; one that frames race as a 'social construction' and which unpacks the individual, institutional, and cultural forms of racism.Online materialsPublic Broadcasting Service, 'Race – The Power of an Illusion'http://www.pbs.org/race/000_General/000_00-Home.htmStarting from the supposition that 'Race is one topic where we all think we're experts', the series, readings, video, and ability to directly ask questions of experts in the field (e.g.: historian George M. Fredrickson and biological anthropologist Alan Goodman) together help to debunk many of the core beliefs that undergird the modern white supremacist and nationalist movement. In so doing, the program helps to show how social, economic, and political conditions, rather than biological make-up, disproportionately channel advantages and opportunities to whites.Public Broadcasting Service, 'From Swastika to Jim Crow'http://www.pbs.org/itvs/fromswastikatojimcrow/index.htmlThe website includes a video, discussion guide, and multi-chaptered narrative on the little-known story of German refugee scholars, who were expelled from Nazi Germany, migrated to the United States south and faced oppression from US white supremacists, and found employment at historically black colleges and universities. The resources therein illuminate the intricate web of politics, migration, nationalism, the contextual construction of racial and ethnic identity, and racism & antiracism.'Racism Review'http://www.racismreview.com/blog/Launched in 2007, 'Racism Review' is produced and maintained by Joe R. Feagin (Texas A&M University) and Jessie Daniels (CUNY-Hunter College). Contributors to the blog are scholars and researchers from sociology and a number of other social science disciplines across North America. Many of the articles center on the topics of white racial identity, racism, and antiracism, and aim to serve as credible and reliable sources of information for journalists, students, and members of the general public who seek evidence-based research and analysis.Southern Poverty Law Centerhttp://www.splcenter.org/index.jspThe Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) was founded in 1971 as a small civil rights law firm, and today the website for the SPLC is internationally known as a clearing-house for critical information, and perspectives on, white supremacist and white nationalist groups.Sample syllabus'Sociological Perspectives on Whiteness'Overview of the courseThis course investigates the social construction of race through an exploration of white identity, both theoretically and empirically. It includes an investigation of the historical genesis of white identity, its intersection with political movements and organizations, the relation of whiteness to race, ethnicity, class, gender, nation, and how whiteness is understood in popular culture, and the sociological mechanisms by which it is reproduced, negotiated, and contested.Lecture 1 – Introduction to Race as a Social ConstructionHaney López, Ian F. 1998.

abstract = {Crowdsourcing, or "obtaining information or services by soliciting input from a large number of people," is becoming known for the impressive productivity of projects that ask the public to help transcribe, describe, locate, or categorize cultural heritage resources. This essay argues that crowdsourcing projects can also be a powerful platform for audience engagement with museums, offering truly deep and valuable connection with cultural heritage through online collaboration around shared goals or resources. It includes examples of well-designed crowdsourcing projects that provide platforms for deepening involvement with citizen history and citizen science; useful definitions of "engagement"; and evidence for why some activities help audiences interact with heritage and scientific material. It discusses projects with committed participants and considers the role of communities of participants in engaging participants more deeply.},

Against the yardstick of a democracy theoretical framework, two participatory instruments (European Citizens' Consultations and the Commission's online consultations) are assessed. Both instruments are seriously flawed: the ECC cannot resolve the trade-off between demanding and egalitarian participation, and remains almost unrecognised outside the forum (bridging problem). Online consultations suffer both from a lack of active participation and of the symbolic accountability of the Commission to the contributions of ordinary citizens.},

This article examines the changing nature of the connection between citizens, party members and elites in the creation of party policy through the theoretical prism of individualisation. Using qualitative case studies of recent policy-making initiatives in the Australian Labor Party and the UK Labour Party, the article develops a new model of policy transferal that is not built upon the mass-party model of parliamentary politics, but rather upon organisational evolutions such as community consultations, online participation and supporters' networks. These evolutions, or reforms, typically emphasise the individuality of policy-making and accountability, promote new technologies for facilitating decision-making, and attempt to engage with a new style of politically active citizen. Each of these developments carries implications for how political parties facilitate participation, accountability and responsiveness in modern forms of representative democracy.},

The broader context is that of urban development in the age of mobility [defined as a new methodological paradigm in social sciences in recent works by John Urry (See for instance: Sheller, M. and J. Urry (2006). The new mobilities paradigm. Environment and Planning A 38 (2): 207–226; and Urry, J. (2007). Mobilities. Cambridge: Polity Press.)].Among the many forces shaping the development of the economic and social fabric of cities, universities are possibly the most important. Not only because academies produce knowledge, which is the main input for the contemporary information-based service economy, one that is strongly urban in nature, but also because universities draw to cities large and varied student communities, and increasingly so, as student mobility booms across the world. In general, this is now seen as a highly desirable thing, due to the 'turn' in local politics towards the attraction of talent and the nurturing of creative lifestyles.Cities thus develop as 'temporary playgrounds' where students not only study and learn, but also perform their peculiar cultural and social life, establishing a rupture with traditional citizenships based on work and permanent residence. They undergo studentification, in the sense of an urban landscape progressively shaped by the practices of students, that is accompanied by more or less overt policy initiatives to accommodate this dynamism as a source of gains to specific sectors of the community (real estate companies, to start with).However, studentification also poses a series of urban management problems, especially in relation to other user groups. This is best analysed making reference to the historical evolution of student settlements, which tend to follow a distinct pattern, framed by the type and location of campus facilities and by changes in the value structure in the city. The end result could be suboptimal, to the extent that the influence of students on the urban economy is underplayed and the conflicts with the local population are maximised.In this article, we propose a simplified 'model' for this evolution and address the problems and policies that should steer this development towards a better integration of students in the social and economic fabric of the city. We use the two cases of Barcelona and Lille, cities that have been thriving from the emergence of distinct student landscapes in their recent regeneration, as exemplary illustrations of that development and of mistakes and wise decisions in policy-making.Author Recommends1. Allinson, J. (2006). Over-educated, over-exuberant and over here? The impact of students on cities. Planning, Practice and Research 21 (1), pp. 79–94, doi: 10.1080/02697450600901541This article represents a broad analysis of the development of higher education in the UK and of the implications at the local level. It discusses how UK cities have come to absorb the increase in student populations (almost doubled to 1.2 million in the decade of the 1990s as a result of lifelong education policies) in specific urban areas where they produced major impacts, mostly presented in negative terms. It so does by investigating the reasons for the 'clustering' of students in certain areas of cities, considering the impacts of studentification on the 'indigenous population' of these areas and discussing the implications for the general vitality of those cities.2. Hubbard, P. (2008). Regulating the social impacts of studentification: a Loughborough case study. Environment and Planning A 40 (2), pp. 323–341, doi: 10.1068/a396This paper defines studentification as a process by which specific neighbourhoods become dominated by student residential occupation. Outlining the causes and consequences of this process, this paper suggests that studentification raises important questions about community cohesiveness and that intervention may be required by local authorities if social and cultural conflicts are to be avoided. Detailing the social impacts of studentification in Loughborough, a market town in the English East Midlands, the paper accordingly considers recent housing policies designed to prevent the formation of exclusive 'student ghettos'. The paper concludes by suggesting that the relationship between students and the wider community requires differentiated responses in terms of regulation if town–university tensions are to be effectively managed. The paper also compares the Loughborough case with other UK university towns where the challenges and opportunities associated with studentification have been differently addressed.3. Chatterton, P. (1999). University students and city centres – the formation of exclusive geographies. The case of Bristol, UK. Geoforum 30, pp. 117–133, doi:10.1016/S0016-7185(98)00028-1This paper analyses critically the presence of students in city centres and the internal articulation of this cohort, the power forces that are responsible for attracting them into cities and developing student-oriented landscapes, and the forms of exclusion and conflict with original urban functions that result from this development. It especially focuses on infrastructure connected to the middle-class students' social activity, which adds up to 'segregating' post-modern trajectories of British (and in general Western) cities. The approach is critical because for this author the 'studentification' of cities is vested in the public discourse as a positive, desirable move towards a creative economy. The study is based on a case study of Bristol city centre.4. Felsenstein, D. (1996). The university in the metropolitan arena: impacts and public policy implications. Urban Studies 33 (9), pp. 1565–1580, doi: 10.1080/0042098966501Among many other similar research-based papers, this is possibly the most comprehensive study of the economic impacts of universities in metropolitan areas, as it takes into consideration both expenditure generated by the academic community and knowledge-related linkages. These impacts can have either positive or negative signs and can operate in both the short and long terms. The article uses a case study of the impacts of Northwestern University on the Chicago metropolitan area. The analysis emphasises the magnitude of the university expenditure links with the metropolitan economy and the importance of scale when comparing these with more localised negative impacts. It then discusses some public policy implications, centred on the role of the university as a non-profit organisation competing with local businesses and as an export base sector in the metropolitan economy.5. Florida, R. (2003). Cities and the creative class. City & Community 1 (2), pp. 3–19, doi: 10.1111/1540-6040.00034The main persona behind the increasingly popular – and frequently criticised –'creative class' concept moves in this paper from the definition and characterisation of this grouping of symbolic mediators and producers, seen as the backbone of (and paradigmatic asset for) urban development in the information age, to the strategies that cities should deploy to attract and retain these human resources, ranging from investments in infrastructure and symbolic capital to softer interventions to strengthen knowledge assets (including top higher education facilities), city image, communication style and integration programmes, to be delivered by coalitions of public and private stakeholders.6. Hall, P. (1997). The University and the City. GeoJournal 41 (4), pp. 301–309, doi 10.1023/A:1006806727397In this article, one of the most celebrated scholars in urban studies discusses the historical evolution and the existing models of university campuses as an economic booster for cities and regions. It so does by examining a number of exemplary cases of campus development in various areas of the world and in different periods, and focusing on the role of technical and vocational universities. It then analyses the new challenges facing university planning at the beginning of the information age.7. Martinotti, G. (1997). Perceiving, conceiving, achieving the sustainable city. Synthesis report. Dublin: European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions.This work by the Italian urban sociologist is an extract of his most famous work (only published in Italian) Metropolis. In his works, urbanisation is conceived as the progressive superimposition in the urban space of populations characterised by different ties with place and different space–time patterns in its use. The 'third-generation metropolis' hosts various population groups: the sedentary original residents plus commuting workers, immigrant workers and students, tourists and global business travellers, characterised by increasing levels of mobility and transience in the city, and a different power to mould the values and images of urban landscapes according to their specific performances and lifestyles, sometimes generating conflict and exclusion. The sustainable city is one that manages to accommodate such diversity, building bridges between such groups and deriving strengths from their coexistence.8. Russo, A. P., van den Berg, L. and Lavanga, M. (2007). Towards a sustainable relationship between city and university: a stakeholdership approach. Journal of Planning Education and Research 27 (2), pp. 199–216, doi: 10.1177/0739456X07307208This article focuses on the relations between the main actors behind the economic dynamics of the triple helix: universities, enterprises and government, and on the urban policies that could fine-tune their local interests. It does so by adopting a stakeholders' approach: academies, firms and governments are embodied by communities (respectively the body of lecturers and especially students, entrepreneurs and workers, and original residents) that establish various ties with place and transactions between them. The paper looks into the balance that should be achieved in their search of an 'optimum' in their citizenship, accounting for differences in their ties with place and survival strategies, and into the reasons for which this balance could be hampered, and so collective benefits from their collaboration missed. It then proposes a number of policy initiatives that aim at redressing such balance and achieve a knowledge-based economy more solidly rooted to place.9. Russo, A. P. and Arias Sans, A. (2009). Student communities and landscapes of creativity: how Venice –'the world's most touristed city'– is changing. European Urban and Regional Studies 16 (2), pp. 175–189, doi: 10.1177/0969776409102189This third article co-authored by A. P. Russo focuses on students as active agents in cultural production, enhancing the attractiveness of urban areas where they settle for empathic cultural consumers. This is a particularly relevant issue for heritage cities, as most historical university cities around Europe, and especially Venice, the case study treated in this paper. In this city, where mass-tourism landscapes, residential spaces and student settlements have historically been spatially and temporally segregated, increased student mass is now producing a new dynamics for which some cultural tourists become patrons of student-oriented activities, breaking up with the spatial and behavioural model of mass tourism. The paper generalises arguing that 'unbranded' creative actors are strategically important for the regeneration of mass-tourism enclaves and argues that in order to stabilise this process, residence and citizenship issues need to be solved.Cities, Universities and Urban Development: Topics for elaboration and discussion1.

Author's introduction
People participate in social movements and protest events in part to pressure elites and institutions to alter the reward structure within society. When attempting to pressure their targets, activists are often confronted by the state. Whether the state is a target of protest or not, it oftentimes engages those seeking to promote extra-institutional change. Within democratic societies, police are charged to maintain social order and protect the rights of those expressing dissent. Because of this dual charge and a variety of political, social, and economic factors, police have adopted strategies or repertoires of social control for policing protests. These repertoires can facilitate, channel, or prevent protest from occurring. A growing scholarly consensus suggests that since the 1990s, authorities in the United States and other democratic states have shifted how they react to protests. Until the 1970s, police often utilized what scholars call the 'escalated force' protest control repertoire. During this era, police saw protest as an illegitimate form of political expression. They placed a low priority on freedom of speech and assembly and often used excessive force and widespread arrests when dealing with protesters. In the 1970s to 1990s, police developed what is called 'negotiated management' to respond less confrontationally to protesters. This repertoire relied on a permitting process to facilitate police and protester efforts to negotiate the time, place, and manner of protest activities in ways satisfactory to both protesters and police. Police placed a premium on protecting freedom of speech and assembly and tolerated community inconveniences related to large rallies, marches, and the occasional staged arrest. They used violence and arrests as a last resort and only for significant violations of the law. However, following the disruptive 1999 Seattle WTO protests and the new cycle of global protests that followed, law enforcement agencies around the United States and in other western democracies began developing and adopting the 'strategic incapacitation' repertoire of protest control. With strategic incapacitation, police selectively protect civil liberties and selectively tolerate community disruption, and they seek to incapacitate protests through the use of less-lethal weapons and preemptive arrests, extensive control of public space, reliance on 'new surveillance' technologies, and the elaborate control of information. In the United States, the development and adoption of this new style of policing accelerated after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks as authorities embraced a risk management approach to identify and neutralize potentially disruptive events, such as large demonstrations.

Boykoff's book explores how the U.S. government, with assistance from federal, state and local law enforcement regularly disrupted protest movements in the 20th Century. It catalogues various forms of suppression employed by authorities from the use of direct violence, surveillance, and infiltration to the use of less direct means of mass media manipulation and demonization. Chapter 1 includes a good introduction to social movements and dissent/resistance, and the concepts of repression and suppression.

This collection of essays consolidates some of the best thinking of the time on protest policing. Together, it provides a comparative historical, institutional and cultural analysis of protest policing across a variety of democratic nations. The contributors explore recent trends in the evolution of protest policing, such as whether protest policing has become 'softer' and the causes and consequences of such changes. The introductory chapter identifies important variables that define the style of protest policing employed and provides a useful model to explain the different styles. The second chapter by McPhail, Schweingruber and McCarthy introduces 'negotiated management' to the scholarly lexicon and has become one of the most influential writings on protest policing. This book should be at the top of your reading list on the topic.

This collected works is a follow up to della Porta and Reiter's earlier volume described above. It explores changes in protest policing in western democracies that parallel the rise of transnational protests in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Contributors analyzed policing efforts at protests coinciding with various international summits and other large protest events. Collectively, they investigated the question of whether a new era of policing is emerging to replace the softer styles of protest policing identified in the earlier volume. Individually, authors explored a variety of topics including the transnational character of the protests and of the police effort to control these protests, how adoption of a 'new penology' paradigm within the U.S. criminal justice influenced police adoption of strategic incapacitation, and the negotiation practices used by police and activists and problems that can occur during negotiations. A concluding chapter identifies a typology of coercive, persuasive and information strategies used by police across nations to control transnational protests.

This book maps efforts by the state to control social movements in a global age. Written by activist-scholars, the research draws from participant observations made at 20 major alter-global protest events held during major global summits over the last decade. The book explores the spatial dynamics, political economy and police violence associated with efforts to repress those opposing aspects of the global political-economic order. A concluding chapter explores activist resistance to the social control of dissent employed by the authorities.

Waddington explores public order policing across a variety of events, from commodity riots and hooliganism to labor and global protests. The first two chapters provide a detailed exploration of theories and debates within the public order policing literature, including various approaches to policing and theories on the causes of public disorder. The remainder of the book adeptly uses the theories covered earlier and other scholarly works to analyze the policing of these differing types of events.

Introduction, issues, and problems (2 weeks)
Definitions, problems, and issues: What is the role of police in a democratic society? What is the tension or paradox between police as protectors of democracy and simultaneously potential threats to democracy? What are civil liberties? What is public order policing? How has US policing become militarized, and what are the consequences of this trend? What is 'broken windows' theory, and how has it shaped law enforcement practices in general?

Is the Internet more inclusive—especially towards the young—than traditional forms of participation requiring physical contact? Do people learn more by discussing on the Internet—and especially in online political forums—than by deliberating face-to-face? We aim to answer these questions by presenting the results of research based on the observation of a deliberative experience that allowed both online and face-to-face participation, namely the IDEAL-EU project, carried out by the Tuscany (Italy), Catalonia (Spain), and Poitou-Charentes (France) regions. IDEAL-EU was aimed at involving young people—between ages 14 and 30—to discuss the issue of climate change in order to produce a report to be handed to the President of the European Parliament Commission on Climate Change. It first consisted in online discussion forums, and then in an electronic town meeting organized in the three regions' capitals in November 2008. This town meeting involved both keypad voting and face-to-face discussions in small groups. The comparison of these two stages of the experience allows evaluation of the respective effects of online and face-to-face political discussions on young participants' political knowledge. Using content analysis of websites, direct observation of the assembly, and interviews and questionnaires completed by both online and assembly participants, we evaluate the respective effects of these different forms of civic engagement for actors' perceived level of knowledge on climate change and on their political competence more generally.},

This paper reports on research within the EU-funded MATISSE project to develop tools and methods for Integrated Sustainability Assessment (ISA), a novel interdisciplinary and participatory approach to sustainability strategy development. Two different methods – expert focus groups and citizen deliberative workshops – were employed to elicit knowledge and preferences of European stakeholders in respect of sustainable mobility. Findings from these exercises indicate areas of both convergence and divergence in the visions of sustainable mobility futures depicted by different stakeholder groups. Stakeholders agreed on the need to address problems of unsustainability in the transport sector, and identified broadly similar environmental, social and economic criteria for sustainable transport. Amenity of transport was more important for citizens, while experts focussed on pragmatic and technological issues. Both groups favoured modal shift and novel technologies, and citizens also supported demand reduction measures and choices; however, a range of barriers to achieving sustainable mobility was also identified by participants. Stakeholder feedback suggests the process was valuable and acted as a forum for social learning and the co-production of knowledge by citizens and experts, while at the same time empowering these groups to participate in an important social issue such as transport. The value and limitations of these methods for ISA are discussed and avenues for further research proposed. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.},

abstract = {Authors' IntroductionIntergroup bias is one of the most actively researched topics in the field of social psychology. Hundreds of books and thousands of research articles have addressed this issue over more than half a century. Although the psychological roots of blatant prejudices are well documented, the development of more subtle and often unintentional forms in societies in which its expression is discouraged poses new and unique challenges to the pursuit of justice and equality in contemporary society. Our interests in the psychological underpinnings of prejudice as researchers and educators are both practical and conceptual. On the practical side, understanding the nature of contemporary forms of prejudice has clear implications for developing effective techniques for combating bias and discrimination. In 1967, nearly 3 years after the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, race riots in the United States prompted the Kerner Commission to investigate the sources of racial tension. Upon the conclusion of its investigation, the commission cited White America's failure to assist Blacks in need, rather than actively trying to harm Blacks, as a primary cause of racial disparities and, ultimately, civil unrest (Report of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, 1968). Indeed, it was research on the differential helping behavior of politically liberal Whites toward Black and White motorists who were stranded on a highway that represented the first empirical work on aversive racism (Gaertner, 1973). Considerable subsequent research on aversive racism has revealed that the consequences of subtle bias can be as severe and pernicious as those of blatant prejudice. Conceptually, the complexities of contemporary forms of prejudice and recent advances in techniques and tools for studying non-conscious biases make this research area an exciting and challenging one. We hope that this guide can help orient educators to the many excellent resources that exist and convey our enthusiasm for exploring what psychological methods and theories can contribute to understanding one of the most challenging social issues faced in contemporary society.Author RecommendsBooks

Although course content will emphasize the causes and consequences of traditional and contemporary forms of racial bias in the United States, other forms of 'isms' will also be explored, both nationally and cross-nationally. Topics will include psychological and behavioral manifestations of blatant and subtle forms of bias, prejudice in everyday interpersonal interactions, techniques for reducing conscious and non-conscious biases, and emerging developmental and neuroscientific perspectives on intergroup bias.Requirements and GradingThe primary requirements of the course are to complete assigned readings and actively participate in class discussions, which include posting reading responses to the course bulletin board in advance of class discussions and serving as a co-facilitator of one class discussion. Grading for the course will be based on discussion participation (25%), weekly reading responses (25%), a mid-term 'exam', which may involve alternative exercises such as debates on key controversies in the field (25%), and a final 12–15-page research proposal (which should relate to students' personal research interests, 25%).Course ReadingsReadings for each class will include selected chapters from the recent edited volume by Dovidio, Glick, and Rudman (2005) reflecting on Allport's seminal book, and two to three journal articles illustrating relevant processes. Optional readings are indicated for some topics to provide interested readers with additional information. Class facilitators will also have the flexibility to choose alternative articles for the class to read, with the permission of the instructor. All readings will be made available through the course website.TextsAllport, G. W. (1954/1979). The Nature of Prejudice (25th anniversary edition). Cambridge, MA: Perseus Books. (Optional)Dovidio, J. F., Glick, P., & Rudman, L. A. (Eds.). (2005). On the Nature of Prejudice: Fifty Years after Allport. Malden, MA: Blackwell. (Selected readings)AssignmentsReading responses. Students will be asked to post a two- to three-paragraph reading response to the online course bulletin board by 7 p.m. the evening before class. Reading responses can incorporate a wide range of questions/comments, including (but not limited to) identifying key issues that are confusing or need clarification, highlighting strengths and weaknesses of the research, discussing alternative explanations, possible boundary conditions, discussing theoretical and/or practical implications of the study findings, identifying points of contact with other readings or prior class discussions, and/or describing alternative ways of testing the study hypotheses.Class facilitator. To allow flexibility to accommodate student interests, students will be asked to co-facilitate one class. Students will work with the instructor to organize the class, formulate questions, and highlight key controversies to guide class discussion. In addition, facilitators will identify a 'stump the chump' study from an empirical article. The article should be one that is not covered in the readings and that illustrates a key insight related to the topic. For this exercise, the student facilitator will describe the design of the study and will ask the class to make predictions and formulate a rationale for these predictions before revealing the study results.Research proposal. A short research proposal (12–15 pages) will be due at the end of the semester. The proposal should build on a topic relevant to the study of prejudice but ideally relate to one's own research interests. The paper should be in APA format and include a thorough introduction (background), a methods section, a proposed results section, and a discussion of the contribution such a project would make to the field.ItineraryWeek 1: Prejudice: Past and Present (DGR Ch. 1)Duckitt, J.

Prejudice Reduction: What works? A critical look at evidence from the field and the laboratory. Annual Review of Psychology,60, 339–367.Optional:Class ExerciseConfirmation Bias in ActionInstructor Preparation: Prepare stick-on labels (one for each student) with a single trait (e.g., lazy, ambitious, athletic, etc.) printed large enough to be visible at a distance of 5–6 feet.Exercise: Place the trait labels in an envelope and ask each student to select one label at random and place it on the forehead or chest of the student to his or her left, such that the trait remains to be visible to all members of the class except for the student for whom the trait was selected.Is Fate at Work? Ask each student to provide the class with a brief (1–2 min) verbal description of what he or she did over the summer or winter break. Upon the conclusion of each description, ask the class to formulate questions for the speaker with the aim of assessing whether or not the speaker's personality actually reflects elements of the randomly chosen trait (i.e., is fate at work?). Relay to the class that any question is a fair game, as long as it does not mention the assigned trait or a synonym of the trait.Author Commentary and Discussion: Following this exercise, it is useful to discuss Darley and Gross's (1983) classic study on confirmatory bias and a recent adaptation and extension of this study by Wegener, Clark, and Petty (2006), which tie well into a discussion of processes that work to perpetuate subtle forms of discrimination (see Hodson, Dovidio, & Gaertner, 2002). Indeed, the point of the Darley and Gross study is that people believe that they are objective information processors and that they typically refrain from using non-diagnostic information, such as race or social class, to develop impressions of another person's character or ability when more direct diagnostic information is available. In the Darley and Gross experiment, participants are presented with 'non-diagnostic' information about a young girl's socioeconomic status as being either high or low. Participants are then shown a video of an ambiguous test performance by the girl (i.e., one that reveals both successes and failures). In their study, those who were led to believe that the girl was higher in socioeconomic status developed the impression that the student's performance was well above grade level. In contrast, although the student's performance was identical in both conditions, participants who were led to believe that the student was of low socioeconomic status reported her performance to be well below grade level. Additionally, only those viewing the video developed these strong impressions: whereas those who did not view the video but only possessed the non-diagnostic information guessed that her abilities were at grade level; those who viewed the video believed that they had diagnostic information confirming expectations derived from the non-diagnostic information.In the present exercise, the class questions following each speaker description are often quite revealing, as they frequently expose just how much of our searching for the truth looks to confirm, rather than disconfirm, evidence of a suspected trait or ability. Questions that seek to confirm a trait lead one to think of those situations in which the trait might be true or ability might be revealed. After several such questions, the person answering the questions may come to believe that he or she actually is, for example, quite athletic, which can lead respondents to further confirm the questioner's initial suspicions (or stereotypes) through a self-fulfilling prophecy.This exercise should take 15–20 min.Darley, J.

abstract = {Policy makers, practitioners and academics agree that addressing climate change requires global efforts and that one pillar of any effective approach must include actions undertaken by developing countries. A key mechanism in which developing countries can be engaged is through collaboration to elicit more use of sustainable energy technologies in a region, organization, or community's energy portfolio. Approaches have tended to emphasize the role of the public and/or private sector. An alternative view has also emerged, termed as community approach, noting the absence of civil society actors in the predominant pathways that often characterize technology cooperation in developing countries. Local engagement is important, as it is often these players [whether local governments, community groups, and/or organizations (e.g. hospitals, schools)] who ultimately reap the benefits and/or bear the costs of these technologies. Recent emphasis centres on an enabling environment, recognizing the importance of creating markets for technology diffusion. Tackling the uptake of sustainable energy in a systematic way, emphasis is placed on policies, actors, and institutions. Building on these foundational frameworks, this paper scrutinizes actors and their relationships with a finer grain to better understand sustainable energy technology uptake. The notion is that sustainable energy technology use will increase with the active engagement of local players (earlier on, in a more meaningful way) in the technology cooperation process.},

The framework draws on European, African heritage, Latino, and Native American traditions, but our applications have mostly been within U.S. contexts. In this article, we describe what we learned while using the framework with Palestinian colleagues during an 18-month collaboration. Funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) with the goal of "cultivating an environment of tolerance, dialogue and civic engagement in Palestinian and Israeli schools," Seeds of Peace contracted with Peace First to lead a series of workshops for Palestinian educators; Peace First worked with Lesley University faculty to provide teacher training support. The contract for this project did not include cross-border issues or collaborations; the workshops focused on communication, critical thinking, respect for diversity and dispute resolution/classroom management. Although the project focused on practice, it also included a small research component—designed to test the usefulness of the Peaceable Schools and Communities framework in a new context. In this article, we review the framework and research that helped guide our work, summarize what we learned, and provide some follow-up information. We suggest connections to broader peace education in the region, but we do not address broader regional issues. We close with recommendations about how U.S.-based peace education models might be successfully applied and re-shaped for work in new cultural contexts.},

abstract = {Legal mandates can play an important role in the success of rice fortification programs that involve the private sector. However, merely enacting mandatory legislation does not guarantee success; it requires a coordinated, multidimensional cross-sector effort that addresses stewardship, develops an appropriate rice fortification technology, enables sustainable production and distribution channels through a range of private-sector players, ensures quality, generates consumer demand, and monitors progress. Furthermore, economic sustainability must be built into the supply chain and distribution network to enable the program to outlast government administrations and/or time-limited funding. Hence, mandates can serve as valuable long-term enablers of cross-sector mobilization and collaboration and as catalysts of civil society engagement in and ownership of fortification programs. This paper compares the rice fortification experiences of Costa Rica and the Philippines—two countries with mandates, yet distinctly different industry landscapes. Costa Rica has achieved national success through strong government stewardship and active market development—key elements of success regardless of industry structure. With a comparatively more diffuse rice industry structure, the Philippines has also had success in limited geographies where key stakeholders have played an active role in market development. A comparative analysis provides lessons that may be relevant to other rice fortification programs.},

The civic potential of pervasive computing technologies has been increasingly explored within academic and urban planning communities. One vision is of communities and cities enriched with pervasive computing, where citizens can leverage the new technology and interfaces for their own purposes, and at the same time be empowered to be heard through the use of such technology. This article reports lessons learned from a project that created public human interfaces for interacting with city officials in Oulu, Finland. We focus on civic engagement and reflect on a deployment of public interactive crowdsourcing technologies that are openly available to everyone, right in the heart of the city. The series of field trials reported here involve public displays, mobile phones, and Internet technologies. We find differences in the performance of different kinds of input mechanisms, and present lessons learned from cooperating with officials in a joint civic engagement effort.

In the United Kingdom, for instance, this trend has emerged at national and local levels, in domains as diverse as Education, the Environment and Health Care. Given a general renewal of interest in incorporating public opinion into policymaking, devices such as online consultations and electronic surveys have rendered the appeal to 'the people' seemingly easier. But an important problem arising from involving the public in decision-making exercises through large-scale electronic participatory devices is the amount of textual data generated. Although there is now a large body of literature devoted to commentating and analysing ways in which politicians ought to be involved in listening and responding to public participation in decision-making, issues pertaining to the implementation of such exercises in the light of the volume of information that they produce have largely remained unexplored. In this paper, we assess the potential benefits and shortcomings of using Text Mining methods for the analysis of large-scale consultations submitted via Internet. To this end, the paper reports on the application of computer-aided text analysis to a public consultation organised by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in 2008 on 'End of Life Medicines'.},

Online political discussion is a growing form of political behavior and plays an important role in political deliberation in the new media age. This article examines "daily talk" as a type of political deliberation, and emphasizes two overlooked factors that influence online political discussion: direct government–citizen interactions and perceptions of the importance of new media for online political discussion. It also examines the moderation effects of perceived importance of new media on group communication and government–citizen interaction. Survey data analysis from the 2008 Civic Engagement survey from the Pew Internet & American Life Project (n = 2,251) reveals that citizens' interactions with both members of their political group and government officials have positive influences on the frequency of online political discussion. Meanwhile, the association between online political discussion and online group communication becomes stronger when one perceives that new media are less important as source of political information. The theoretical and policy implications of the findings are discussed.

Yet, the legal doctrines of consent and informed consent differ in their applications. In patient care, the judicial doctrines of consent and informed consent are disclosure doctrines based on the obligation of physicians to inform their patients of the following types of information: the nature of the procedure the physician is recommending in the patent's care (P), the alternatives to the physician-recommendation (A), and the risks of procedure and its alternatives (R). In addition, the physician must provide truthful answers to the patient's questions (Q) to the best of the physician's abilities. In research on humans, the onus of disclosure by study sponsors and principal investigators is much greater than in patient care precisely because the purpose of research is not patient care. The purpose of research is the identification and development of new generalizable knowledge. Thus, participation in a research study or trial may not benefit the study volunteer at all. In addition, the participant may carry a heavy risk burden in relationship to any testing of a newly designed drug or device as part of their experiences in the research study. Presently, despite the risks borne by the research study participant, the raw data collected from volunteers in research trials are treated by courts as if they were the private property of the study sponsor rather than generally owed to the public as would be expected by an effort like research participation aimed at contributing to the development of generalizable knowledge. This paper reviews the obligations that study sponsors owe to their study participants based on the very definition of research as a systematic activity whose purpose is to develop generalizable knowledge to help all humans.Author RecommendsCourt casesCanterbury v.

Arguing that the professional standard and the reasonable person standard of consent and informed consent were insufficient to base a disclosure standard in research on humans, this National Commission developed the reasonable volunteer standard where a study participant is to be approached in research informed consent with that information that a reasonable volunteer would want to know.Online MaterialsBelmont Report:<http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/guidelines/belmont.html>SyllabusTopics for Lecture and DiscussionWeek I: Introduction and OverviewReadings:Rogers v.

* • How do the judicial doctrines of consent in England and Australia compare to the judicial doctrines of informed consent in the United States and Canada?
* • How does a professional standard of disclosure differ from a reasonable person standard of disclosure?
* •What is the definition of research?
* • How is a research study (study proposal and research informed consent form) reviewed from scientific and ethical bases for considerations of approval by an IRB?
* • How do the obligations of a study sponsor, a principal investigator, and a research team conducting a research trial on human study participants differ from the obligations of a physician caring for a patient?
* • Should all raw data of research derived from humans be made available to the public for use in developing generalizable knowledge to help others, or should raw data be considered the private property of the study sponsors (for example, prescription drug manufacturers), who fund the research trials?Seminar/Project IdeaDraw a timeline of the development of the basic concepts of consent and informed consent in patient care and in patient research. On this timeline, first place the dates of the key court cases in England, the United States, Canada, and Australia on consent and informed consent. Then place the date of the development of the Belmont Report. Why do differences exist between these four countries in terms of the legal requirements of informedness of a patient (in medical care) and a study participant (in medical research)? What roles if any do the concepts of self-determination and self-decision have in consent and informed consent in patient care and in informed consent in research on humans among the four countries of interest? What are the realities of research on human participants that require a new standard of informed consent, the reasonable volunteer standard, to be developed beyond the two standards in patient care, the professional standard, and the reasonable person standard?Counterpoint ArgumentsThe following are counterpoint arguments that need to be appreciated to more fully understand the concepts that impact the thesis that 'raw data' should be open to the public to allow the opportunity of checking of the results of its associated scientific paper and for further analysis.De-Identified (Anonymized) Raw DataA current approach to identifying (anonymizinig) raw data is based on the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 (P.L.104-191). HIPAA was enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1996 to keep a person's medical information private. In a research study, a person's private medical information can become research data. HIPAA's Privacy Rule allows a covered entity to de-identify data by removing all 18 elements that could be used to identify the individual or the individual's relatives, employers, or household members; these elements are enumerated in the Privacy Rule. The covered entity must also have no actual knowledge that the remaining information could be used alone or in combination with other information to identify the individual who is the subject of the information. Under this method, the identifiers that must be removed are the following:
* 1 Names.
* 2 All geographic subdivisions smaller than a state, including street address, city, county, precinct, ZIP Code, and their equivalent geographical codes, except for the initial three digits of a ZIP Code if, according to the current publicly available data from the Bureau of the Census:
*  2a.The geographic unit formed by combining all ZIP Codes with the same three initial digits contains more than 20,000 people.
*  2b.The initial three digits of a ZIP Code for all such geographic units containing 20,000 or fewer people are changed to 000.
* 3 All elements of dates (except year) for dates directly related to an individual, including birth date, admission date, discharge date, and date of death, and all ages over 89 and all elements of dates (including year) indicative of such age, except that such ages and elements may be aggregated into a single category of age 90 or older.
* 4 Telephone numbers.
* 5 Facsimile numbers.
* 6 Electronic mail addresses.
* 7 Social security numbers.
* 8 Medical record numbers.
* 9 Health plan beneficiary numbers.
* 10 Account numbers.
* 11 Certificate/license numbers.
* 12 Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license plate numbers.
* 13 Device identifiers and serial numbers.
* 14 Web universal resource locators (URLs).
* 15 Internet protocol (IP) address numbers.
* 16 Biometric identifiers, including fingerprints and voiceprints.
* 17 Full-face photographic images and any comparable images.
* 18 Any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code, unless otherwise permitted by the Privacy Rule for re-identification.Even though 'raw data' can be de-identified (anonymized) so that there is no way to trace back the data to the study participant from which it was drawn, there are still questions whether the 'de-identified raw data' can be given to other researchers or made public without the original study participant's approval. It may be the case that this approval could be done at the start of any research study where the individual considering study participation would be counseled on what the process of de-identification consists of and would be asked whether the participant would allow use of the data by other researchers or made available to the public in a de-identified state. However, there may be questions of the study participants as to whether the data are truly de-identified and untraceable back to the study participant since the participant would not be able to see the process actually being carried out in detail in all relevant circumstances.Using Raw Data in ContextSimply being in possession of raw data is never enough to build on that data from a research perspective. Researchers need to understand the context of the scientific research study in which the data were collected. This research context includes (but is not limited to): (i) the scientific hypothesis of the research study, (ii) the inclusion and exclusion criteria selected by the research designers of the study to determine which study participants were included and which were excluded from the study, (iii) the methods used to collect the data and possibilities of errors in the data collection processes, and (iv) answers to questions regarding whether any data were excluded from the study data and why these data were excluded.Ownership Rights Over DataThere are ownership rights over data. Ownership rights include court decision making related to the question which parties are to be considered as the owners of the data. Possible owners here include (but are not limited to) (i) the study sponsor whose only role was to fund that study, (ii) the principal investigator(s) who developed the scientific hypothesis, and (iii) individual study participants through special contracts made by individual participants who negotiate such contracts with study sponsors and principal investigators to share in the ownership of data. Examples of such data are participant sources of unique gene lines or unique cell lines to be used in future research.Objections to Data SharingFinally, individual researchers may simply object to sharing data. A researcher's arguments here may be simply stating that he or she has a right to fully analyze the data since the collection of the data was the researchers' idea in the first place. These researchers may argue that they have the right to mine the data as fully as they can before deciding to make the data open to the public for others to analyze.Works Cited

Although some celebrate new possibilities for political life, others are concerned that it can lead to network insularity and political detachment. This study examined how mobile-mediated discourse with strong ties interacts with characteristics of those ties to predict levels of political participation. Findings revealed that mobile-based discourse is positively associated with political participation, but that this relationship is moderated by the size and heterogeneity of one's network. Participation increases with use of the technology in large networks of like-minded individuals, but declines with use of the technology in homogeneous networks that are small. Implications and future research considerations are offered in the discussion.},

Context
Inclusion of people who use mental health services in policymaking is a goal of many mental health systems. However, the outcomes of such involvement have not been well articulated or researched.

Objectives
The objectives of this research were to explore how the social and personal outcomes of citizen-user involvement in mental health policymaking were conceptualized by policy actors and to create a conceptual framework to guide the development and evaluation of citizen-user involvement.

Design
This qualitative instrumental case study explored the phenomenon of citizen-user involvement using the policy field of mental health and social housing policy in the Province of Manitoba, Canada, as the focal case.

Participants
A total of 21 informants from four policy actor groups, citizen-users, representatives of advocacy organizations, government officials and service providers, participated in key informant interviews. Data also included policy documents relevant to the policy field.

Analysis
Data collected from interviews and policy documents were analysed using an inductive qualitative paradigm.

Results
Participants identified multiple outcomes of citizen-user involvement in policymaking. The resulting conceptual framework illustrated how outcomes in personal, substantive, instrumental and normative dimensions influence micro-, meso- and macrosocial structures. The results also provided a cautionary tale by suggesting how attention needs to be paid to managing the risks as well as optimizing the rewards of involvement.

Conclusions
The framework has application in guiding the development and evaluation of mechanisms that aim to involve citizen-users in policymaking. The framework encourages an approach that takes into account the complexity and multidimensional nature of engaging citizen-users.

Participants were 114 Italian high school students aged 14–17 years (57 % boys). Path analysis was used to evaluate the proposed theoretical model. Results showed that Facebook informational use was associated with higher levels of adolescent perceived competence for civic action, both directly and through the mediation of civic discussion with parents and friends (offline). Higher levels of civic competencies, then, were associated with a stronger intention to participate in the civic domain in the future. Our findings suggest that Facebook may provide adolescents with additional tools through which they can learn civic activities or develop the skills necessary to participate in the future.},

This paper explores ways of challenging the current interpretation of international education policy through the concept of global citizenship drawing on the discussion forums of two cohorts of participants in an online course. The participants' responses illustrate ways they are rethinking the purpose of international higher education and the relevance of the concept of global citizenship. Whilst most participants whole-heartedly endorsed a more holistic view of higher education, several issues were raised, especially the fit of the ideal of global citizenship with a capitalist society and the Western heritage of the concept, which were perceived to be troublesome issues. Resistance to the inclusion of education for global citizenship was anticipated from institutions and disciplines, both heavily invested in the status quo. The academics' personal beliefs about higher education, and their willingness and potential to design and deliver curriculum for global citizenship were also prominent. Although universities are beginning to include the term global citizen in their policy documents the extent to which this might influence the goals and curricula of higher education is yet to be realised.},

The Marketing of Higher Education as Institutional Boundary Work', Sociology Compass 6(3):205–18.Authors' introductionThe marketing of higher education refers to a structural trend towards the adoption of market-oriented practices by colleges and universities. These organizational practices blur the boundary between knowledge-driven and profit-driven institutions, and create tensions and contradictions among the three missions of the 21st-century university: knowledge production, student learning, and satisfying the social charter. In this article, we highlight the historical contexts that nurtured the marketing of higher education in the US and Europe and explore the dilemmas that arise when market logics and business-oriented practices contradict traditional academic values. We demonstrate that managing these dilemmas is a contested process of policing borders as institutional actors struggle to delineate the proper role of the university in a shifting organizational climate.Authors recommendArum, Richard and Josipa Roksa. 2011. Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.A book that asks a fundamental question in higher education: "How much are students actually learning?" The results do not reflect well on the institution. Arum and Roksa conduct longitudinal tests of critical thinking and analytic reasoning skills on a cohort of students at a variety of universities and colleges. They find that a majority of respondents demonstrate little to no improvement in learning outcomes. Even students who improve show modest gains. The authors' analysis of student surveys suggests that a major culprit is a combination of low rigor in the curriculum, a lack of effort among students, and the overly modest expectations of instructors.Barnett, Ronald. 2010. 'The Marketised University: Defending the Indefensible.' Pp. 39–51 in The Marketisation of Higher Education and the Student as Consumer, edited by M. Molesworth, R. Scullion and E. Nixon. New York: Routledge.Barnett suggests that debates about the effects of marketization on higher education often reflect pre-existing ideologies about the nature of markets in general. He presents numerous arguments in favor of the conception of students as consumers. For example, the increased power students receive in choosing where and from who to take classes may encourage accountability and actually improve the learning experience as students take a more active role in charting their own course through their education. Barnett also reminds readers that different institutions create different contexts and the extent to which market models of higher education are applicable are largely dependent on these different contexts.Berman, Elizabeth Popp. 2012. Creating the Market University: How Academic Science Became an Economic Engine. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.An in-depth historical sociology of the entrepreneurial university, this book explores when and why academic science become increasingly tethered to commercial interests over the last four decades. Berman focuses primarily on patenting trends and the political history of patenting law, as well as the development of biotech entrepreneurship and the emergence of university-industry incubators. She argues that the trend toward an entrepreneurial model were largely driven by the ideals of government officials about the importance of translating scientific and technological innovation into economic growth, along the way creating the organizational environment necessary to enable market-oriented research to flourish.Kleinman, Daniel Lee. 2003. Impure Cultures: University Biology and the World of Commerce. Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin Press.Kleinman provides an in-depth look into the daily work culture of a plant pathology lab at the University of Wisconsin. This participant observation study includes ambitious critiques of the dominant agency-oriented approaches within science and technology studies by focusing on issues of structural constraint and institutional power. This study is especially good at demonstrating how university biologists are deeply, athough indirectly, constrained by commercial interests. The influence is not easily found in conflicts of interest or day-by-day decision making of scientists, who by and large conduct themselves ethically and in the fashion predicted by Mertonian norms of science. Instead, the culture of commerce impacts an array of daily lab practices, including the baseline epistemological assumptions around what is a "significant" finding. In the world of plant pathology, a successful trial is determined in relation to the metrics established by the field's resource dependency on the agro-chemical industry.Leslie, Larry L. and Gary P. Johnson. 1974. 'The Market Model and Higher Education.'The Journal of Higher Education 45:1–20.This landmark article is among the first to interrogate the use of a market model as it applies to higher education. The authors trace several key legislative measures that altered federal funding practices and gave students discretion in choosing which schools would receive the most funding. While the authors draw similarities between market practices and the process of funding higher education through students, they also question the extent to which a market model of higher education is applicable. Drawing a contrast between higher education funding practices and a perfectly competitive market model, they provide an important critique of a funding system still in use today.McMillan, Jill J. and George Cheney. 1996. 'The Student as Consumer: The Implications and Limitations of a Metaphor.'Communication Education 45:1–15.This article warns of the dangers involved in recasting students as consumers. McMillan and Cheney synthesize arguments about the traditional goals of education and how treating students as consumers can threaten traditional classroom relations and alienate students from the learning process. Implicit in their discussion is an argument for more traditional classroom approaches to fostering democratic citizenship skills through critical analysis and communal sharing of ideas. They explicitly reject the notion of education as a product (rather than a process) and the demand for professors to deliver the product in the most entertaining and efficient manner.Owen-Smith, Jason and Walter W. Powell. 2002. 'Standing on Shifting Terrain: Faculty Responses to the Transformation of Knowledge and Its Uses in the Life Sciences.'Science Studies 15:3–28.An interview-based study of 80 scientists from two university campuses, this paper provides a typology of faculty identities and research strategies at the nexus of academic and commercial research within the life sciences. The typology includes "old" and "new school" orientations to commercial research as well as hybrid categories somewhere between these two extremes, such as "engaged traditionalists" and "reluctant entrepreneurs." Eschewing simplistic analyses that either condemn or glorify the commercial engagements of academics, Owen-Smith and Powell point out that these various positions have created both novel fault lines and innovative research within the life sciences.Radder, Hans. 2010. The Commodification of Academic Research: Science and the Modern University. Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh Press.This book is an edited collection of essays on the history, extent, and contemporary impacts of commodification on academic research in the US and Europe. Most of the essays converge at the intersection of science studies and research policy, but are written by an impressively eclectic group of authors pulled from philosophy, sociology, government studies, epidemiology, genomics, and bioethics.Vallas, Steven Peter and Daniel Lee Kleinman. 2008. 'Contradiction, Convergence and the Knowledge Economy: The Confluence of Academic and Commercial Biotechnology.'Socio-Economic Review 6:283–311.This is an interview-based study of biotech science that develops a theory of the "asymmetrical convergence" that characterizes the two sides of the university-industry relation. Vallas and Kleinman describe the work situations of university and commercial scientists to show that there has been a convergence of norms and practices across academic and corporate institutional domains. The authors show that the open discovery ideals of academic science have been increasingly integrated the entrepreneurial values and practices imported from the private sector. Simultaneously, commercial laboratories brought scientific practices and concepts into their workplaces. However, the convergence is asymmetrical, in the sense that both fields of practice are dominated by the profit motive and bottom-line economic development rather than the communal norms of public science.Online materialsResearch Commercialization and SBIR Centerhttp://center.ncet2.org/This web-based organization provides an online venue for faculty and students to take virtual workshops and webinars on how to engage in research capitalization and entrepreneurial training.

The article includes a short summary of the historical and contextual differences in the European and American models of higher education.For more advanced students of organizations, the article provides a case study demonstrating how macro level institutional changes influence organizational climate and social actors' perceptions of their own work. Further, advanced or graduate seminars in education may choose to highlight the various debates about the role of (higher) education in an increasingly knowledge-based economy.Focus questions
* 1 Discuss examples of how market logics may have influenced your coursework, choice of classes, or commitment to a class.
* 2 What do you think about the informal economy and buying and selling course notes and study materials?
* 3 Discuss examples in which you put more or less effort into a class based on your perception of the course's bottom-line benefit to your post-graduation career and/or income.
* 4 How might the pressures faced by professors to bring in research funds from industry or venture capital influence their work and commitment to the classroom? In your experience, does this seem to be more common within those subject areas where knowledge capitalization is fairly common, such as biotech or computer science? Or, can we see the influence of knowledge capitalization in humanities or social sciences too?
* 5 To the extent that students have adopted an understanding of higher education as a commercial exchange, in which they are customers who pay for grades, etc., what might be some ways in which we could change that perception? What changes would faculty need to make in order to change student attitudes? Administrators? Students themselves?Seminar/Project ideasExploring Institutional BoundariesInterview a few other undergraduate students plus at least one faculty. Ask students questions such as why they decided to come to college, how they decided which college to attend, what they like and do not like about their college education, and what they hope to get out of their college experience. Ask faculty to provide their perspective on why they became a professor, what they like about their job and what they dislike, and what they see as the purpose of college and what students should get out of the college experience. In what ways do faculty and student perspectives converge, and how do they differ? Do any of the differences suggest blurring boundaries between missions of the university (knowledge production, student learning, and satisfying the social charter)?Marketization in Your College/UniversityDo a content analysis of official university admissions brochures, websites, and videos. What messages does the college want you to get from these materials? In what ways might the marketization of higher education be evident in such materials? If the university makes historical materials available, ask students to compare such materials over time to discern an increase in marketization, and how such processes are manifested. Do admissions materials for undergraduates and graduate students emphasize the same things? What differences do you note? Why do you think such differences do or do not exist?},

Context
Telecare and telehealth developments have recently attracted much attention in research and service development contexts, where their evaluation has predominantly concerned effectiveness and efficiency. Their social and ethical implications, in contrast, have received little scrutiny.

Objective
To develop an ethical framework for telecare systems based on analysis of observations of telecare-in-use and citizens' panel deliberations.

Design
Ethnographic study (observation, work shadowing), interviews, older citizens' panels and a participative conference.

Setting
Participants' homes, workplaces and familiar community venues in England, Spain, the Netherlands and Norway 2008–2011.

Results
Older respondents expressed concerns that telecare might be used to replace face-to-face/hands-on care to cut costs. Citizens' panels strongly advocated ethical and social questions being considered in tandem with technical and policy developments. Older people are too often excluded from telecare system design, and installation is often wrongly seen as a one-off event. Some systems enhance self-care by increasing self-awareness, while others shift agency away from the older person, introducing new forms of dependency.

Conclusions
Telecare has care limitations; it is not a solution, but a shift in networks of relations and responsibilities. Telecare cannot be meaningfully evaluated as an entity, but rather in the situated relations people and technologies create together. Characteristics of ethical telecare include on-going user/carer engagement in decision making about systems: in-home system evolution with feedback opportunities built into implementation. System design should be horizontal, 'two-way'/interactive rather than vertical or 'one-way'. An ethical framework for telecare has been developed from these conclusions (Table 1).

In Britain this has become a particular concern as levels of democratic engagement in traditional politics have declined, exacerbated by media reports of politicians' untrustworthy behaviour. A common feature of previous empirical work on political trust is that trust is treated as a single theoretical concept. Scholars have assumed that trust operates in a similar fashion across different political institutions—that citizens' trust mechanisms are the same for trusting parliament, the prime minister or the European Union. As a consequence, the operationalisation of trust has generally been through a single measure. In this article we draw on recent research from political theory, where different forms of judgements whether to trust—strategic, moral and deliberative—have been conceptualised, to argue that trust judgements may vary in application and significance depending upon the institution under examination. Using specially designed data sets generated from YouGov's weekly omnibus and the British Election Study's Continuous Monitoring Panel, we operationalise these three forms of trust judgements to examine trust in two British institutions—political parties and politicians. We find, as hypothesised, that different forms of trust judgements are of differing significance depending upon the institution under consideration.},

abstract = {Authors' IntroductionThe article is an attempt to assess a body of historical and polemical writing on Australia's entry into the First World War. It also offers, from page 70 through to page 74, an alternative to the kind of understanding of Australian participation in the war with which we take issue elsewhere in the article. The piece was inspired by our engagement with the important writing of John Moses, who was for some years a valued colleague at the University of New England; in Frank's case, as a university lecturer teaching a course on War and Society in Twentieth-century Australia and a scholar with a long-standing interest in Australian historiography, and in Grant's, as a doctoral candidate being supervised by Frank and researching a thesis on Australian responses to the outbreak of the war. Grant, who was in the process of completing his thesis when we published this article, has since finished and is revising his work for publication. He also produced an earlier historiographical piece arising from his doctoral work : '"Unbounded Enthusiasm": Australian Historians and the Outbreak of the Great War', Australian Journal of Politics and History, 3/3 (September 2007): 360–74.Like any piece of academic historical writing, our article represented an attempt to solve a 'problem'. The 'problem', as we saw it, was why a group of historians and political commentators had spent so many words contesting a view which they presented as mistaken historical orthodoxy, but which we were unable to find articulated in the major writings on Australia and the Great War with which we were familiar. The writers with whom we argued suggest that, contrary to the claims of radical-nationalist historians, the Great War was truly Australia's war, and one in which Australia's vital interests were at stake. Our purpose in writing our article was not to contest their particular claims about the national interest, but rather to interrogate aspects of their own methodology and assumptions, and to suggest an alternative. In particular, we argued that their work came out of a focus on 'high politics' and diplomacy, and that a closer look at the contemporary discourse suggests greater complexity and ambiguity about the significance of the war for Australians. We suggested that it was wrong to impose a single meaning on Australian participation in the war derived from an understanding of diplomatic history, and that attempts to do so needed to be understood in the context of modern Australian conservative intellectuals' affirmative attitude towards the nation's imperial inheritance.Authors Recommend:Here, we have included readings that are not dealt with in any detail or at all in our article. These come out of the tradition of social and cultural history or 'history from below' that, we argue in our article, has been marginalised by the stress on high politics and diplomacy. Many of these historians are participants in those 'liveliest conversations' to which we refer in our concluding paragraph.E. M. Andrews, The ANZAC Illusion (Melbourne: Cambridge University Press, 1992).An outstanding study of Anglo-Australian relations during the war. Andrews did not argue that Australia should not have been involved in the war, but rather that the extent and manner of Australian cooperation was not in Australia's interests. 'The Anzac Illusion' to which he refers is the idea of the superiority of Australian soldiers to those from other parts of the British Empire, and the notion of a 'special relationship' between Australia and the United Kingdom. Andrews explores the interests that these 'illusions' actually served. His is a wide-ranging study that examines diplomatic, administrative, economic and social history. His eye catches topics as diverse as the organisation of the Australian Imperial Force, wheat sales, military discipline and British war brides.Peter Cochrane, Simpson and the Donkey: The Making of a Legend (Carlton: Melbourne University Press, 1992).A powerful examination of the legend of the Simpson, the Man with the Donkey at Gallipoli. Simpson became famous for carrying the wounded on the back of his donkey to safety, and his name became synonymous with selfless sacrifice, as well as a range of other qualities Australians like to associate with themselves and especially their soldiers. Cochrane attempts to separate the known facts about John Simpson Kirkpatrick's life from the uses to which his image was put during the First World War itself, and in the decades that followed. Like Andrews, Cochrane's is a 'critical' history that seeks to contextualise the stories that some people have told about the war by exploring the purposes that they have tended to serve.Joy Damousi, The Labour of Loss: Mourning, Memory and Wartime Bereavement in Australia (Melbourne: Cambridge University Press, 1999).One of a new group of histories concerned with issues of memory and bereavement. Whereas books such as Ken Inglis's Sacred Places (see below) concentrate mainly on the public expression of community bereavement, Damousi is more concerned with writing a history of private emotions. At the same time, she examines how those who experienced private grief as a result of the war fared when they sought public recognition of their suffering. People's grief became the basis for a re-fashioning of their identity. The book examines both the world wars.J. N. I. Dawes and L. L. Robson, Citizen to Soldier: Australia before the Great War: Recollections of Members of the First A.I.F (Carlton: Melbourne University Press, 1977).An account of the generation that went to war in 1914–18, based on interviews carried out with the men themselves. This book provides a useful indication of the motives of those who enlisted or, at the very least, how they recalled their motives in their old age. The drawing of this kind of distinction, and reflection on the way in which memories are made and re-made in the course of a single life, have become especially important in the increasingly sophisticated oral histories produced about Australia and the war (see Thomson, Anzac Memories, below).Raymond Evans, Loyalty and Disloyalty: Social Conflict on the Queensland Homefront, 1914–18 (Sydney: Allen & Unwin, 1987).There are several regional or state-based studies of the Australian home-front experience of the war, and Raymond Evans's study of Queensland in among the best. Evans's book comes very much out of a left-wing critical tradition of writing about the war, in which there is a strong emphasis on its socially polarising, rather than unifying effects. Evans's argument is not that the war created such class, ethnic and ideological divisions – they were already fundamental to Queensland society – but that the stresses of war sharpened them, leading to violence and state repression of dissent.Stephen Garton, The Cost of War: Australians Return (Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1996).A major study of the impact of three wars, the First World War, Second World War and Vietnam, on those who fought and returned, and the society to which they belonged. Like many recent Great War histories, Garton's explores the intersection of individual memory and experience with larger cultural patterns. He is especially concerned with the problems faced by returned men, such as mental trauma, physical disability and the difficulty of settling back into 'normal' community life after the rupture caused by the war. He also examines the role played by governments and key professionals such as doctors in attempting to manage this complex process.K. S. Inglis, Sacred Places: War Memorials in the Australian Landscape (Carlton South: Melbourne University Press, 1999).One of the most important books written by any Australian on the experience of war, Sacred Places was the culmination of more than three decades of professional reflection by one of the country's leading historians on Australia's experience of the First World War. A detailed and beautifully written and illustrated study of Australian war memorials – from the nineteenth century through to the present – it is an exploration of the complex ways in which Australian communities expressed their grief and gratitude to those who had served the nation in war.Tanja Luckins, The Gates of Memory: Australian People's Experiences and Memories of Loss and the Great War (Fremantle, WA: Curtin University Books, 2004).Here is another contribution to the literature on memory and loss, a book that like those by Garton, Damousi and Scates, draws attention to the more personal and intimate aspects of the First World War experience for those left behind to grieve. For instance, Luckins includes an account of women's practice of wearing mourning black in memory of the fallen. In much of this recent cultural and social history, there has been a growing recognition of the ways in which the experience of war not only touched the lives of those left behind during the conflict itself, but continued long after the last shots were fired, as loss was reconstituted as memory. There is also an attempt in these histories to recover experiences that have been lost or neglected in histories with a traditional focus on battlefield sacrifice and national identity. Women's experiences, in particular, have been brought into clearer focus by historians such as Luckins.Jenny Macleod, Reconsidering Gallipoli (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2004).Macleod's book is the first cultural history to set the Australian and British understandings of the Gallipoli campaign carefully alongside one another. Her interest is in the rather different ways in which the campaign has been recalled in the two societies. Macleod traces this process of cultural representation and memory back to the earliest descriptions of the campaign by war journalists such as Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett and C. E. W. Bean, through the Dardanelles Commission and accounts by Sir Ian Hamilton, as well as soldiers' tales and the later historiography.L. L. Robson, The First A.I.F.: a study of its recruitment 1914–1918 (Carlton: Melbourne University Press, 1970).This book remains the standard account of the First AIF, although much work still remains to be done on the social history of this large body of men. Robson used both qualitative and quantitative techniques in building up a profile of the soldiers, an account of the efforts to recruit them, and the effects of the successes and failures of recruitment campaigns on Australian society and politics.Michael McKernan, The Australian People and the Great War (Nelson: West Melbourne, 1980).This is a pioneering social history. McKernan's focus is on the home front, where he examines a range of topics, from the experiences of women, country folk and German-Australians, through to the war's impact on the churches, schools and sporting activities. McKernan later produced a sequel on the Second World War.John McQuilton, Rural Australia and the Great War: from Tarrawingee to Tangambalanga (Carlton South, Vic.: Melbourne University Press, 2001).This book's scope is somewhat narrower than its title implies, for it is a regional study of north-eastern Victoria. It is nevertheless a significant social history by an accomplished rural historian, suggestive of the experiences of rural Australians more generally. Rural Australia and the Great War is very much a modern 'history from below', in the Australian First World War historiographical tradition pioneered by the likes of Lloyd Robson, Bill Gammage and Michael McKernan. Indeed, McQuilton covers some of the same topics that featured in these histories, such as recruitment, conscription, schools, churches and the experiences of women and German-Australians, but in relation to a particular regional and rural context.Bruce Scates, Return to Gallipoli: Walking the Battlefields of the Great War (Melbourne: Cambridge University Press, 2006).Visiting Gallipoli or the Western Front as a tourist is now a common experience for many Australians, but Scates explores not only this recent phenomenon – via surveys and interviews – but the much longer history of battlefield pilgrimage from the 1920s. Return to Gallipoli is a contribution to the growing body of Australian historical literature on the history of the emotions and the memory of war. Moreover, like Ken Inglis's Sacred Places, this moving book explores the feelings that attach to place and the complexities faced by Australians whose daily lives continued so far away from the bodies of their loved ones.Graham Seal, Inventing ANZAC: the Digger and national mythology (St. Lucia, Qld.: University of Queensland Press in association with the API Network and Curtin University of Technology, 2004).There are many studies of the Anzac Legend as an aspect of national identity, but some scholars have been especially interested in the impact of the Great War experience on Australian popular culture. While there was an 'official' culture of Anzac commemoration, there was also a more everyday, informal digger culture that emerged especially out of the stories that soldiers told one another, and the outside world, about their experiences. Graham Seal, a leading folklorist and social historian, examines this culture in its wartime and postwar manifestations, and the way in which it diverged from, yet also contributed to, the national myth that has grown up around Anzac.Alistair Thomson, Anzac Memories: Living with the Legend (Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1994).Based on interviews with old diggers carried out in the 1980s, Thomson's study explores the relationship between the private memories of a number of returned soldiers, and the more public memorialising and mythologising that has accompanied Australia's experience of war. He discusses the difficulties and frustrations some of these men experienced when their own memories and understanding of the experience of being a soldier contradicted the authorised public memories.Online Materialshttp://www.awm.gov.au/The Australian War Memorial in CanberraThis is an outstanding Web site for Australian war history.

* 2Which kinds of evidence might be used for a study of Australians' attitude to  the outbreak of war in 1914?
* 3Why did Australia go to war in 1914?
* 4What does Australia's entry into the war reveal about its people's identity and  sense of their place in the world in 1914?
* 5In what ways is distance significant in explaining Australian attitudes to the  war?Seminar/Project IdeaFor Undergraduate StudentsIndividual Project: Designing a World War I PosterIt is July 1915, the middle of a major recruitment drive, and your task is to design a recruitment poster to persuade young Australian men to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force. Give some thought to the kinds of appeal that you will make. In particular, consider such factors as nationalism, imperialism and masculinity.Once you have completed your poster, compare your effort to some actual Australian Great War recruitment posters. You will find some examples at http://www.firstworldwar.com/posters/australia.htm.What themes in your own poster are echoed in those from the First World War? Are there any themes in the World War I posters that you didn't consider? Are there themes in your own poster that don't occur in those on the Web site. Try to account for these differences.},

There are legitimate political, economic, and organizational reasons for doing so, but these gains may come at the expense of a more substantial and efficacious role for citizens who wish to use e-mail to engage in public participation. This paper situates a close examination of the 1000 longest modified MoveOn. Org-generated e-mails sent to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) about its 2004 mercury rulemaking, in the broader context of online grassroots lobbying. The findings indicate that only a tiny portion of these public comments constitute potentially relevant new information for the EPA to consider. The vast majority of Move On comments are either exact duplicates of a two-sentence form letter, or they are variants of a small number of broad claims about the inadequacy of the proposed rule. This paper argues that norms, rules, and tools will emerge to deal with the burden imposed by these communications. More broadly, it raises doubts about the notion that online public participation is a harbinger of a more deliberative and democratic era.},

We find that engagement in online discussion forums can lead to modest shifts in preferences among those who choose to contribute to the discussion. However, because those who choose to engage in this way are a small and self-selecting minority who make little use of background information, questions remain about the utility of online discussion forums as effective means of engaging citizens to generate informed inputs into the policy process.},

Such technological advancements have progressively eased GIS accessibility from expert users to ordinary citizens, accompanied by considerable growth in adopting PPGIS for traffic and transit, volunteered geographic information, and customer relationship management. However, limited use of PPGIS for higher levels of participation such as decision making is found. Barriers to PPGIS adoption for decision making seem less technological and more institutional.},

abstract = {Changing faces of citizen action:For the activist, the academic interested in power and politics, the development practitioner and the engaged citizen, the last couple of years or so have offered a veritable treasure of moments with which to re-imagine the world, and the place of the 'citizen' in it, the relationships between rulers and the ruled, and the very meaning of 'democracy'. In this context this working paper develops an approach based on thinking at the IDS about 'Unruly Politics', a framework that offers new ways to understand and engage politics and political action. 'Unruly Politics' is a broad conceptual space rather than a descriptive or nominal category. Broadly, it is an approach that looks at politics beyond what has conventionally been defined as 'politics', institutionally and formally. It is simultaneously the insistence on new languages of politics, the redefinition of spaces of politics, ruptures in the aesthetic regimes of power, and the creation of imaginaries of power beyond what is already intelligible.This publication is constituted of 5 pieces in conversation with each other. The first piece, the main paper, brings together theoretical approaches from philosophy, anthropology and activism with four case studies – the Egyptian uprising as one part of the 'Arab Spring', the protests in Greece, the hunger-strike that sparked off an anti-corruption movement in India, and the more diffuse context of the role of Information and Communication Technologies such as mobile phones and internet platforms in citizen action. The paper examines new modalities of political action being generated in these contexts and argues that current approaches to citizen action, (approaches concerned either with the relationship between citizens and state apparatus, or identity related collective action) characterised by the assumptions of that politics relates to 'interests', or 'representation', fail to appreciate the potential of these emergent modalities. The paper also asks whether the framework of 'citizenship' is adequate for understanding these modalities, whether 'conscious engagement' or explicit ideological interpretation of action is necessary to constitute it as political, how we might understand the role of ICTs in these emergences, the role of the 'bare life' in generating unruly political action and the usefulness of the notion of 'Event' in understanding the changing face of citizen action. The main paper concludes with a discussion on the cynical deployment of discourse in politics, and argues that several of the recent events might be seen as generating the possibilities of a politics that is not cynical.Main paper is followed by three essays written by academics, activists and development practitioners in response to the main paper. Sonia Correa, Shahrukh Alam and Ute Seela each engage the paper from different locations, contesting claims and examining implications of the arguments therein, providing insights from their own locations and perspectives. The final piece of the publication is a response to these essays, highlighting the directions of thought and practice that these engagements open up, clarifying particular points and making some final provocations.},

The question of how to do more, but without doing more of the same, can perhaps be answered partially through the use of some of the recently developed and innovative tools that build on Web 2.0 and by the application of Citizen Relationship Management. This article discusses a simple input-output Public-Private-Citizen Collaboration (PC2) framework which reflects the collaborative interactions through which public and private stakeholders can exchange and process information with citizens. The framework highlights the need for genuine involvement of the public and suggests that by utilising new Web 2.0-based tools citizens can participate both in the processes of creating and crafting web-based content and in enhancing service design. If used in relation to PPPs such tools may very well be able to help governments access much needed information so as to both better visualise and actualise public value in PPP-based service delivery.},

However, participation can become a tool for the effective implementation of policy rather than a means to enhance justice, if no power is transferred to citizens. Displacement in Amsterdam is a case in point. Here the local council together with housing corporations yearly forces over 2,000 households to leave their houses, a consequence of an ambitious policy of state-led gentrification. Following Foucault, I explore the rationalities and techniques employed to ensure compliance. The promise of influence lures tenants into lengthy discussions with power holders. Investment choices are presented as objective facts and so provide a rationale for the disruptive interventions. Participation thus provides government a platform to impose its views in a context of severe power asymmetries, while alternatives are marginalised and dissent is disciplined.},

This article develops the idea of a "democracy bubble" as the intersection of open access to participatory venues and inflated citizen expectations for what the participatory processes can deliver. It develops related ideas of a "democracy crater," "democracy dropouts," and "democracy demand." Three fully online or online-mediated Obama administration participation initiatives are assessed for their potential to lead to a democracy bubble: the development of Open Government Plans, the Electronic Town Hall meeting, and co-produced community forums on health care and job creation. A primary finding is that the administration can do a better job establishing and managing expectations for what can be achieved through participation in its various initiatives.},

Recent decades have seen an increasing emphasis on linking the content and aims of science teaching to what the average citizen requires in order to participate effectively in contemporary society, one that is heavily dependent on science and technology. However, despite attempts to define what a scientific education for citizenship should ideally involve, a comprehensive set of key aspects has yet to be clearly established. With this in mind, the present study sought to determine empirically the extent of any consensus in Spain regarding the principal aspects of scientific competence that citizens should possess in order to function adequately in everyday life. This was done by means of a three-stage Delphi process involving 31 participants drawn from among leading and acknowledged Spanish scholar-scientists and engineers, researchers and private sector scientists, philosophers of science, science educators, and science communicators. The outcome of this process was a set of five aspects for which there was both consensus and stability. Several of these aspects were also found to be interrelated. There was a tendency for higher ratings to be given to aspects related to attitudes and/or values than to those referring to knowledge. It was in relation to the latter, along with other aspects concerning the nature of science, that discrepancies were observed among the different professional groups surveyed. Comparison of the present results with the content of previous reports indicates that in recent decades the ability to think critically and skills related to the interpretation of information have been considered to be important aspects for citizens to acquire as part of their scientific education. It is argued that the five key aspects identified in this study should be considered jointly in the context of school science education, since they are interrelated skills that citizens will require when tackling important issues and making decisions in various spheres of their life (personal, social, professional, etc.). © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Adoption of e-government has increased in most countries, but at the same time, the rate of successful adoption and operation varies from country to country. This article outlines the evolution of ICT in the public sector over the past 25 years. It presents general trends by examining interactions and mutual shaping processes between ICT evolution and several inter-related institutional changes including government operations, public services delivery, citizen participation, policy and decision making, and governance reform. The authors suggest that within a short time period, e-governance has evolved rapidly from rudimentary uses of ICTs as simple tools to support highly structured administrative work to the integration of ICT throughout government operations. The growing use of Web 2.0, social media, and mobile and wireless ICT by citizens can also heavily impact the way public services are delivered and how citizen engagement processes are carried out. However, new management approaches, governance structures, and policy frameworks are still missing, posing a challenge for governments to operate effectively in the age of big data. Generally, developing countries are lagging behind in e-government adoption compared with developed countries. Thus, for developing countries to successfully adopt ICT and try to leapfrog some of the obstacles encountered by early ICT adopters in developed countries, systematic analyses need to be conducted to understand the interactions among stakeholders and ICTs and co-create the institutional environment to lead to a positive impact of ICT on public administration. Only when this relationship is clearly understood can innovative ICTs be seamlessly integrated into the governance structure. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

However, the social network which is formed behind the scene of microparticipation is usually ignored by both researchers and practitioners. This article combines community detection in social networks with information retrieval methods, to detect and label communities of project followers and cores of interest in the network of urban infrastructure project stakeholders. We study dynamics of the network and its communities by monitoring them over time. This technique is used to analyze followers of a Light Rail Transit (LRT) project in microblogging website Twitter and profile them based on their interests and ideas they support. Although methods of this article can be readily applied to other cases where connectivity of project followers and their descriptions are retrievable, our work is mainly interested in how to analyze Twitter discussions without any assumption that they replace the other online or offline means of public involvement in infrastructure projects.

Given the disappointing results in increasing consumer involvement in health services via 'choice' and 'voice' participation strategies, the question of how the more challenging approach of co-production will fare needs to be addressed. The article discusses the possibilities and challenges of system-wide co-production for health. It identifies the discourse and practice contours of co-production, differentiating co-production from other health consumer-led approaches.

abstract = {Author's IntroductionOver the last 25 years, the environmental justice movement has emerged from its earliest focus on US social movements combating environmental racism to an influential global phenomenon. Environmental justice research has also undergone spectacular growth and diffusion in the last two decades. From its earliest roots in sociology, the field is now firmly entrenched in several different academic disciplines including geography, urban planning, public health, law, ethnic studies, and public policy. Environmental justice refers simultaneously to a vibrant and growing academic research field, a system of social movements aimed at addressing various environmental and social inequalities, and public policies crafted to ameliorate conditions of environmental and social injustice. Academia is responding to this social problem by offering courses under various rubrics, such as 'Race, Poverty and the Environment, Environmental Racism, Environmental Justice', 'Urban Planning, Public Health And Environmental Justice', and so on. Courses on environmental justice offer students opportunities to critically and reflexively explore issues of race and racism, social inequality, social movements, public/environmental health, public policy and law, and intersections of science and policy.

In this course, we will explore case studies of environmental injustice, theories of body, space, nation, and colonialism; and think through possibilities for resistance, sovereignty, and environmental justice. The course materials are derived from ethnic studies, environmental justice studies, and feminist theory to provide multiple interdisciplinary perspectives on the state of race, inequality, and environment.Logistics: You can reach me by email, in my office hours, or by appointment at any time during the quarter. I respond to students' emails by 10 am every weekday; I do not answer students' emails on weekends. I do not accept late assignments or assignments submitted electronically. This syllabus is subject to change; any changes will be announced well in advance in class or by email. Please refer to the UCSD Principles of Community (http://www.ucsd.edu/principles) for guidelines on standards of conduct and respect in the classroom.

Case Studies in Environmental Racism and Environmental Injustice In this unit, we will explore cases of environmental injustice through four major frameworks that will be used throughout the course: 1. The social construction of identity and power (of race/racism, gender/patriarchy, sexuality/heteronormativity, etc.); 2. The intersectionality of identity and power; 3. The relationality of privilege and inequality; and 4.

After several attempts to reduce violence and crime, there seems to be an agreement that preventive actions are the best way to address this problem. Trying to help deal with that challenge, this paper proposes a mobile collaborative application, named Personal Guardian, which is used by civilians while walking in urban areas. The application is focused on crime prevention and it implements participatory sensing to help people be aware of the risks that appear to exist in a certain place at a certain time. Based on that information, citizens can take appropriate and on-time preventive actions. The system is supported by a human-centric wireless sensor network, and it is complementary to the security solutions already used by public and private organizations. The system architecture and its main components are described, and the main requirements and design decisions are also discussed. A preliminary evaluation of the solution was conducted to determine its strengths and weaknesses in terms of quality of service. The obtained results indicate that the information feeding process is more relevant for end-users than the unattended delivery of awareness information about their personal security. In addition, this former capability does not require to be adjusted to the end-users' context. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Study Design  A systematic review of the literature.Objectives  To describe which environmental factors have an impact on community participation of persons with an intellectual disability.Methods  A systematic literature search was conducted for the period of 1996–2006 in Pubmed, CINAHL and PSYCINFO. Search terms were derived from the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. Three investigators assessed the relevance of the studies identified using predefined selection criteria. Aspects of community participation included were: domestic life; interpersonal interactions and relationships; major life areas; community, civic and social life. Environmental factors included were: products and technology; natural environment and human-made changes to environment; support and relationships; attitudes; services, systems and policies.Results  Out of 236 initial hits, 9 quantitative studies and 2 qualitative studies met the predefined selection criteria and were included in the study. Various research instruments were used in the studies and only one study used a conceptual framework. The review allowed the identification of a number of environmental factors positively affecting participation: opportunities to make choices; variety and stimulation of the environment of facilities; opportunities for resident involvement in policy making; small residential facilities; opportunities for autonomy; vocational services; social support; family involvement; assistive technology; and positive staff attitudes. A number of identified environmental factors negatively affecting participation are: lack of transport and not feeling accepted.Discussion  It can be concluded that little has been published about the impact of environmental factors on community participation. Many studies do not clearly define the concept of community participation. Research on the impact of environmental factors on community participation so far seems not to be based on a theoretical framework. Most studies focused on the impact of services on community participation in general.},

Recent literature reviews have consistently identified youth–adult partnership (Y–AP) as an effective type of youth participation across highly diverse contexts. These same reviews, however, note that indicators of Y–AP have not been conceptualized and validated for measurement purposes. The present study addresses this limitation by developing a brief measure of Y–AP that is explicitly grounded in current theory, research, and community practice. The measure was administered to youth in the United States, Malaysia, and Portugal (N = 610). Validation was assessed through factor analysis and tests of factorial, discriminant, and concurrent validity. Results confirmed the two predicted dimensions of the Y–AP measure: youth voice in decision making and supportive adult relationships. These two dimensions were also found to be distinct from other measures of program quality: safety and engagement. As predicted, they also significantly correlated with measures of agency and empowerment. It is concluded that the measure has the potential to support community efforts to maximize the quality of youth programs.},

The European Forum on Epilepsy Research (ERF2013), which took place in Dublin, Ireland, on May 26–29, 2013, was designed to appraise epilepsy research priorities in Europe through consultation with clinical and basic scientists as well as representatives of lay organizations and health care providers. The ultimate goal was to provide a platform to improve the lives of persons with epilepsy by influencing the political agenda of the EU. The Forum highlighted the epidemiologic, medical, and social importance of epilepsy in Europe, and addressed three separate but closely related concepts. First, possibilities were explored as to how the stigma and social burden associated with epilepsy could be reduced through targeted initiatives at EU national and regional levels. Second, ways to ensure optimal standards of care throughout Europe were specifically discussed. Finally, a need for further funding in epilepsy research within the European Horizon 2020 funding programme was communicated to politicians and policymakers participating to the forum. Research topics discussed specifically included (1) epilepsy in the developing brain; (2) novel targets for innovative diagnostics and treatment of epilepsy; (3) what is required for prevention and cure of epilepsy; and (4) epilepsy and comorbidities, with a special focus on aging and mental health. This report provides a summary of recommendations that emerged at ERF2013 about how to (1) strengthen epilepsy research, (2) reduce the treatment gap, and (3) reduce the burden and stigma associated with epilepsy.
Half of the 6 million European citizens with epilepsy feel stigmatized and experience social exclusion, stressing the need for funding trans-European awareness campaigns and monitoring their impact on stigma, in line with the global commitment of the European Commission and with the recommendations made in the 2011 Written Declaration on Epilepsy. Epilepsy care has high rates of misdiagnosis and considerable variability in organization and quality across European countries, translating into huge societal cost (0.2% GDP) and stressing the need for cost-effective programs of harmonization and optimization of epilepsy care throughout Europe. There is currently no cure or prevention for epilepsy, and 30% of affected persons are not controlled by current treatments, stressing the need for pursuing research efforts in the field within Horizon 2020. Priorities should include (1) development of innovative biomarkers and therapeutic targets and strategies, from gene and cell-based therapies to technologically advanced surgical treatment; (2) addressing issues raised by pediatric and aging populations, as well as by specific etiologies and comorbidities such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and cognitive dysfunction, toward more personalized medicine and prevention; and (3) translational studies and clinical trials built upon well-established European consortia.

Such work has led to a series of political assertions and subsequent contests. In particular, it is argued that a relational account of place demands a focus on: responsibility both within place, to internal heterogeneity, and beyond place, to the links and connections that sustain place. In such a politics, moments of negotiation and the articulation of multiple demands take centre stage. A number of geographers have begun to challenge such accounts of political practice, arguing that politics remains both a territorially bound, and relationally connected, phenomena. This paper examines these debates over the constitution of place politics, in order to suggest that they might help to develop geography's sense of ethical engagement with both distant, and proximate, strangers.Author Recommends1. Massey, D. (2007). World city. Cambridge: Polity.A clear and accessible account of how a city, in this case London, is constructed through an array of connections and relations both to difference within and beyond its limits. Massey begins to articulate an account of 'politics beyond place' here and clearly outlines the varied spatial scales wherein the responsibilities of place might be drawn.2.

International Journal of Urban and Regional Research 31, pp. 633–645, doi: 10.1111/j.1468-2427.2007.00747.xMalpass et al. provide one of the best applications of Massey's account of a 'politics beyond place', considering how a relational account of the city might be applied to the Fairtrade cities movement. They consider issues of ethical consumption and relations of distance and proximity through interrogating the local–global narratives deployed to promote an idea of fair trade relations within place.3.

Geografiska Annaler 86 (B), pp. 5–18, doi: 10.1111/j.0435-3684.2004.00150.xThis is the paper in which Massey begins to consider the ethical implications of relational thought, through posing a challenge to think politically, and responsibly, about the connections of place. Massey argues for a politics of connectivity, yet one which is sensitive to the specificities, and responsibilities, of place, and in doing so begins to consider how such a politics might be developed in London, a charge she develops further in World City.

Geography and ethics: spaces of cosmopolitan responsibility. Progress in Human Geography 31, pp. 509–518. doi: 10.1177/0309132507077090This paper provides an up-to-date review of recent work on ethics within geography with a particular focus upon issues of cosmopolitan thought and responsibility to strangers both proximate and distant. Popke provides a clear review of different approaches to the demands of urban cosmopolitanism and argues for a localised, and open, engagement with different geographical imaginations placing in question as a result many of our current spatial certainties.5.

Smith considers the history of geography's engagement with ethical theories and clearly examines the challenges posed by both partialist and impartialist accounts of ethical action. Drawing on feminist accounts of an ethic of care, Smith suggests that geography has a key role to play in envisioning an account of ethical thought and action, which is neither a parochial partiality nor a dispassionate impartial universality, but which places the negotiations of demands for care as central.6.

In a clearly written and accessible chapter, Allen considers how issues of exploitation are actively distanced from consumers, while antisweatshop movements use a vocabulary of connection and responsibility to make such issues proximate and demanding. Further chapters in this collection on the demands of citizenship (chapter three) and international politics (chapter eight) are also recommended.7. Castree, N. (2004). Differential geographies: place, indigenous rights and 'local' resources. Political Geography 23, pp. 133–167, doi: 10.1016/j.polgeo.2003.09.010This paper provides a clear overview, and critique, of different areas of relational thought within geography. It examines the contradictions within relational accounts of spatial practice and politics, suggesting a more nuanced take on sociospatial relations. Empirically, Castree provides a detailed reading of the tensions and political negotiations of the global indigenous peoples' movement, negotiations that he argues are shot through with different spatial imaginaries.8. Amin, A. and Thrift, N. (2002). Cities: reimagining the urban. Cambridge: Polity.This is a book that altered the ways in which geographers approach the city. Amin and Thrift's analysis of the interwoven nature of propinquity and flow within the city (chapter two) was one of the first examples of a relational approach being taken to the urban. The book also begins the process of teasing out many of the political implications of a more mobile account of urban life and spatiality.Online Materials1. Fairtrade Townshttp://www.fairtradetowns.orgThe website of the Fairtrade Foundation's Fairtrade Towns initiative. The website includes details on those towns and cities currently holding fairtrade status, how cities, and citizens, can become involved in the campaign and an array of resources for supporting and starting local campaigns. Here there is a focus on how local actions within communities around consumption patterns and decisions can have widespread impacts on livelihoods and communities across the globe.2. SweatFree Communitieshttp://www.sweatfree.orgThe website of a community based social movement promoting local, place specific, action to challenge the exploitation of workers in sweatshops internationally. The movement focuses on activism to promote sweatfree procurement measures among local authorities and organisations as a means to take responsibility for local consumption. The website thus contains details of their Sweatfree Cities initiative as a grassroots effort to encourage the adoption of sweatfree procurement on a city-wide basis.3. National Coalition of Anti-Deportation Campaignshttp://www.ncadc.org.ukNCADC is a campaigning organisation focused on the rights of asylum seekers and refugees in the UK. In particular, the group assist in campaigns against deportations and lobby for the halting of unjust and inhuman deportation practices. Their website contains details of past and present campaigns, how UK residents can become involved in challenging deportations, and focuses upon the ethical responsibility of citizens to do so.Sample SyllabusThe series of discussion sessions detailed below are conceived as part of a wider course on contemporary spatial and political theory. It is intended that such a course would reflect a mix of theoretically and empirically centred work. The aim of this section of the course would be to examine what political and ethical implications arise from relational accounts of space and place.Week I: Introducing relational spatial thoughtThis session introduces this area of geographical thought by examining how space has been conceived as a relational entity. The distinction between notions of place as a bounded container of social activity and identity and relational suggestions that places are the articulation of bundles of connections is emphasised as the basis for differing political positions and stances in relation to calls for ethical responsibility.ReadingAmin, A.

For space. London: Sage.Murdoch, J. (2006). Post-structural geography: a guide to relational space. London: Sage.Thrift, N. (1996). Spatial formations. London: Sage.Week II: The politics of placeRelational accounts of space and place are argued to construct a particular form of political engagement, one centred upon both dealing with the claims of proximate others and negotiating the demands of more distant connections. A distinction is drawn here between inward focused 'place-bound' political projects, and more 'progressive' and 'outward looking''place-based' political projects.ReadingAmin, A. (2004).

Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers 21, pp. 194–214.Week III: Territorial challengesA number of areas of work have begun to challenge the political assumptions of relational modes of thought. In particular, work on geographical regions has suggested that the distinctions between territorial, place-bound politics and a more relational, place-based account are drawn too tightly. The critiques of relational thought posed here suggest that there need not be a privileging of a particular form of political spatiality at the expense of all others.ReadingCastree, N. (2004).

Regional Studies 41, pp. 1171–1191.Week IV: Distant demands and ethical geographyResearch on ethics within geography has focused in part upon the demands that distant obligations pose, and on the role that distance might play in moral partiality. A relational account of space begins to question some of the spatial assumptions that underpin such work, and argues for a more political sense of spatial implication and responsibility. A relational account of responsibility is therefore seen to act as an intervention into discussions over moral partiality.ReadingBarnett, C. and Land, D. (2007).

On the spatial scope of beneficence. Progress in Human Geography 22, pp. 15–38.Week V: Placing responsibilitiesThis session focuses upon examining how geographers have begun to put ideas of the relational responsibilities of place into action. There has been a focus here on both tracing responsibilities temporally, through issues such as reparations for slavery and indigenous land rights movements and, spatially, through the example of sweatshop campaigns.ReadingAllen, J. (2008). Claiming connections: a distant world of sweatshops? In: Barnett, C., Robinson, J. and Rose, G. (eds) Geographies of globalisation: a demanding world.

The Journal of Political Philosophy 12, pp. 365–388.Week VI: Negotiating spatial grammarsThis final session looks towards how these varied stands of political negotiation and demand might be taken forward through recent work within geography on the spatialities of social movements. Here, a relational account of space is taken as simply one form of political articulation and is seen to interact with other political scales and practices. Responsibility, it is argued, arises from pursuing socially just policies and politics through the intersection of different spatial articulations.ReadingAllen, J. and Cochrane, A. (2007).

As policy making for Indian gaming and other tribal issues has shifted from the federal government to state politics and state legislatures over the past several decades, the role of American Indians in the electoral process in state legislative elections deserves greater scholarly attention. We examine changes in voting patterns among state legislative elections over a 40-year period for districts with and without casinos. In the past, Democrats held a large advantage in casino districts both in terms of the two-party vote share and in terms of incumbents running unopposed when seeking reelection. Since the 1990s, this traditional Democratic advantage has largely disappeared to a point where the two parties compete at rough parity in these districts. In several states, American Indians represent a sizeable and potentially influential voting bloc.

This essay explores recent developments in theorizing subjectivity, with a particular focus on medical and psychiatric anthropology. It suggests that studies of violence and humanitarian interventions, new medical technologies, and new modes of citizenship challenge older ways of writing about the subject and lived experience. The essay outlines four claims about the study of subjectivity – that 'subjectivity' denotes a set of issues quite different than classic studies of 'self' or 'person'; that viewing subjectivity through the lens of the 'postcolonial' provides a language and analytic strategies valuable for addressing such issues; that attention to 'disorders', social as well as individual, is critical to the ethnography of subjectivity; and that such ethnography requires theory and methods that facilitate attending to that which is 'unspeakable and unspoken'. The essay then provides three ethnographic vignettes from the author's work in Indonesia, using each to explore a domain central to the ethnography of subjectivity. First, it discusses the importance of the study of the genealogy of the modern subject and of distinctive patterns of modernity for anthropological research on subjectivity. Second, it outlines a particular perspective on the psychological subject. And, third, it addresses 'the eruption of the political', the ethnography of post-conflict settings, and participation in intervention as critical sites for inquiry into subjectivity. The essay juxtaposes Cavell's philosophy of 'the Ordinary' with current psychoanalytic theories as approaches to bringing that which societies and individuals keep 'hidden in plain view' into the purview of writing on subjectivity.

Résumé
Le présent essai explore l'évolution récente de la théorisation de la subjectivité et se concentre en particulier sur l'anthropologie médicale et psychiatrique. Il suggère que les anciens modes de description du sujet et de l'expérience vécue ne sont plus adaptés aux études de la violence et des interventions humanitaires, des nouvelles technologies médicales et des nouvelles formes de citoyenneté. L'auteur met en lumière quatre propositions concernant l'étude de la subjectivité : « la subjectivité » désigne un ensemble de questions différentes de celles des études classiques du « soi » ou de « la personne » ; l'examen de la subjectivitéà travers une lorgnette « postcoloniale » crée un langage et des stratégies analytiques utiles pour aborder ces questions ; il est indispensable pour l'ethnographie de la subjectivité de s'intéresser aux « troubles », sociaux aussi bien qu'individuels; l'ethnographie a besoin d'une théorie et d'une méthodologie facilitant l'examen de ce qui est « indicible et non dit ». L'essai livre ensuite trois instantanés ethnographiques tirés du travail de terrain de l'auteur en Indonésie, en explorant par le biais de chacun des trois un domaine central de l'ethnographie de la subjectivité. Il aborde pour commencer l'importance de l'étude de la généalogie du sujet moderne et des schémas distinctifs de modernité dans la recherche anthropologique sur la subjectivité. Il met ensuite en lumière une approche particulière du sujet psychologique. Enfin, il s'intéresse à« l'éruption du politique », à l'ethnographie des contextes post-conflictuels et à la participation à l'intervention comme autant de points cruciaux dans l'étude de la subjectivité. Cet essai superpose la philosophie de « l'Ordinaire » de Cavell aux théories psychanalytiques actuelles pour amener dans le champ de vision de l'écriture sur la subjectivité ce que les sociétés et les individus tiennent « caché au grand jour ».

An online survey generated participation from 747 current and potential clients of an international consulting company. To evaluate the fit of the data in accordance with the EWPA framework, structural equation modeling was conducted to test the overall fit of the proposed model and to examine the hypothesised relationships between constructs. Analyses confirmed correlations between dispositional cynicism and job-specific affect, supported notable relationships between positive job-specific affect and all work intentions, provided evidence for job-specific affect's mediation of cynicism and work intentions and uncovered a direct negative relationship between cynicism and intent to use organisational citizenship behaviour. Results suggest that state-specific workplace emotions are important for understanding the degree to which employee dispositional cynicism will ultimately influence most performance-related work intentions. However, independent of affect, employee cynicism may directly result in somewhat lower intentions to help others at work. Study limitations and practical implications for employee selection and training are considered.},

Using data from an international survey that included 6130 participants (2198 Spanish, 3932 Italian, Mage = 13.8), this study's results show that relational lifestyles (especially family dialogue and out-of-school cultural activities) are positively related to political and civic participation among children and adolescents.

Limitations of the current study, implications for future policy decisions and applications to children social programs are discussed.},

abstract = {Author's introductionIndigenous peoples are racialized, but this is not the only defining element of their identity. The sociological study of indigenous peoples informs political sociology, as indigenous peoples are a type of non-state actor with a distinct perspective on the state and international governing organizations. The colonial power structure forced indigenous peoples to the margins of their homes and territories, which then changed rapidly around them without consideration of their voices. Today, indigenous peoples are recapturing the space to speak and they are challenging the societies that nearly overtook them and their lifeways.Author recommendsS. James Anaya 1996. Indigenous Peoples in International Law. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.This book examines the historical and contemporary issues regarding indigenous peoples and international law. Key topics include human rights, self-determination, and negotiations with states and international institutions. The appendix includes the text of selected international doctrine related to indigenous rights. Anaya now serves as the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples.Roxanne Dunbar-Oritz 2006.

Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.Indigenous forms of resistance are distinguished from ethnic groups due to their political status. Niezen explores the emergence of the concept of indigenism, the international movement of indigenous peoples. The book examines the international response to indigenous peoples' assertions of sovereignty, diversity and commonalities across indigenous peoples, how assertions of self-determination influence indigenous-state and indigenous-international governing organization relations, and the political implications of indigenous peoples' assertions of self-determination. A brief concluding chapter names the key projects of indigenism: affirming local claims of difference, using the language and symbols of states in claims of self-determination, and embracing the universal concept of human rights to protect and develop identity.Y.

This segment might also fit in a course on racial or ethnic diversity. I explore self-determination in greater detail as it is a key issue to many indigenous peoples and it encompasses everything from the right to territory to linguistic rights to rights to traditional medicine, and more. This segment might also fit into more advanced courses analyzing rights or inequality. I do not recommend readings for the Examining Self-Determination section as the readings will vary depending on your focus (topic or geography).Topics for lecture or DiscussionWeek I: Introduction and OverviewDefinitions, Problems, and Issues: who are indigenous peoples?

Exemplars might include: Native Hawaiians (Kanaka Maoli), Zapatistas, Inuit of Canada and the formation of the Nunavut Territories, and the role of indigenous peoples in the United Nations.Films and videosHomeland: four portraits of native actionThis film looks at the protection of American Indian homelands as a human rights issue and explores four different movements in Native America to protect the environment and indigenous lands: Penobscot, Gwich'in, Northern Cheyenne, and the Dine/Navajo people. The Penobscots are struggling with the state of Maine to sanction a polluting paper mill, the Gwich'in fight drilling in ANWR, the Northern Cheyenne are seeking to stop methane gas wells, and the Dine/Navajo are fighting to stop uranium mining.Peyote roadThis film explores the use of peyote by the Native American Church and the American perspective on the use of peyote. It follows the case of the landmark decision, Employment Devision v. Smith, along with the legislative change that followed this decision. The film also offers a look into the Native American Church with depictions of the role of peyote in ceremonial life.In the light of reverenceThis film explores sacred sites and the conflicts that American Indians face when trying to gain access to these sites to practice their religious beliefs. The film explores four different cases, including the Wintu seeking to gain access to Mt. Shasta and fighting the New Age believers who desecrate ceremonial lands, the Hopi dispute with private land-owners over a peak in the Four Corners region, and Lakota Sioux seeking to gain access to Mato Tipila/Devil's Tower.Adoption of the U.N. declaration on the rights of indigenous peoplesThis is a brief film that documents the occasion of the adoption of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azVhsiLNDZkFocus Questions
* 1What are political challenges to indigenous peoples – locally and globally?
* 2What might be political opportunities for indigenous peoples – locally and globally?
* 3What strategies will allow indigenous peoples to attain their claims?
* 4Who are the indigenous peoples in your area? What are their claims? How has your community responded?Project idea1. Socratic Dialogs. I use this technique to discuss complex problems from many perspectives. During the Socratic Dialog, the students do all of the talking, with minimal intervention on the part of the professor to referee the conversation as needed.During the term, we will often debate topics in Socratic Dialogs. In Socratic Dialogs, the class will respond to a well-formulated question that requires personal responses from participants. The responses to the question will lead to a broader discussion, allowing the class to arrive at a consensus. You will be graded on your participation in Socratic Dialogs, both as Respondents and Questioners. Active participation will be rewarded!Respondents: Respondents will work in pairs to respond to a general question posed by the professor. They must also study the text closely and research the issue at hand in order to be prepared for follow up questions from the professor and classmates. Respondents will be assigned a question one week in advance to allow them to prepare. Each student will act as a Respondent twice during the semester.Questioners: When you are not a respondent, your role is to contribute to the conversation actively by asking questions, offering additional responses to questions, etc ... Use your own experiences to guide you in offering responses or asking questions.Some sample Socratic Dialog Questions include:Are tribal courts − in their contemporary or historical forms – an exercise of tribal sovereignty?Are Native Americans sovereign, even as domestic dependent nations?Is tradition a relevant source of legal doctrine for tribal law in contemporary times?How can sacred sites be preserved and sacred practices remain legal, given that American Indians exist within a foreign culture and state?Land has been called an engine of sovereignty. How can land – scarred by colonial history – also be an engine of justice for American Indians?2. Take Home Exam QuestionsIn my classes on indigenous issues I have used take-home exams in the past. I find this to be a good way to keep the students thinking about issues as they are working, which is always my goal when writing examinations. These exams are designed to help students think creatively and critically about course readings, using them in a way that is different than what we did in class. These two questions focus on American Indian tribes and the American legal system, and the conflicts between these two political bodies.A. Why do we have a course that examines the clash between American Indian and American criminal justice systems? Provide at least three reasons. Use citations to support your claims and examples to illustrate your points. Be sure that you always explain why or how – do not assume that I know what you mean.B. As we learned at the beginning of class, legal structures are very important tools for communities, allowing them to express and protect their values. How does the clash of cultures continue to threaten sovereignty and simultaneously empower the authority of the American federal government? What can tribes do to escape the 'clash' with their sovereignty intact?},

Policy Points:


* Policies and legal protections against weight-based discrimination have broad public support in 4 nations where this discrimination is widely documented.

* Public support was strongest for policies and laws that would prohibit employers from denying employment, assigning lower wages, and refusing promotion to people based on their weight status. Women and individuals with higher weight expressed the greatest support.

* Weight discrimination is common in numerous life settings, creating social and economic inequities and adverse health outcomes. Policies and legal measures protecting against such discrimination need to be developed and implemented in the United States and elsewhere and would have considerable public support.



Context
People viewed as "overweight" or "obese" are vulnerable to weight-based discrimination, creating inequities and adverse health outcomes. Given the high rates of obesity recorded globally, studies documenting weight discrimination in multiple countries, and an absence of legislation to address this form of discrimination, research examining policy remedies across different countries is needed. Our study provides the first multinational examination of public support for policies and legislation to prohibit weight discrimination.

Methods
Identical online surveys were completed by 2,866 adults in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Iceland. We assessed public support for potential laws to prohibit weight-based discrimination, such as adding body weight to existing civil rights statutes, extending disability protections to persons with obesity, and instituting legal measures to prohibit employers from discriminating against employees because of body weight. We examined sociodemographic and weight-related characteristics predicting support for antidiscrimination policies, and the differences in these patterns across countries.

Findings
The majority of participants in the United States, Canada, and Australia agreed that their government should have specific laws in place to prohibit weight discrimination. At least two-thirds of the participants in all 4 countries expressed support for policies that would make it illegal for employers to refuse to hire, assign lower wages, deny promotions, or terminate qualified employees because of body weight. Women and participants with higher body weight expressed more support for antidiscrimination measures. Beliefs about the causes of obesity were also related to support for these laws.

Conclusions
Public support for legal measures to prohibit weight discrimination can be found in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Iceland, especially for laws to remedy this discrimination in employment. Our findings provide important information for policymakers and interest groups both nationally and internationally and can help guide discussions about policy priorities to reduce inequities resulting from weight discrimination.

abstract = {Public policy debate around regulating emerging autonomous weapons systems is vital, but in danger of neglecting crucial challenges. Current analysis focuses around efforts to define autonomy and to incorporate 'autonomous' systems within established regulatory systems, particularly international law and arms control treaties and conventions. This emphasises two key decision moments as the focus of regulation: the initiation of hostilities and target engagement, reflecting the just war tradition that provides the intellectual backdrop for much of this debate. This article suggests this underestimates the significance of the potential consequences of such weapons systems, arguing that this consensus disguises the extent to which autonomy can only be meaningfully engaged within the specific context of the circumstances when such systems may be deployed, and that the speed of decision-making by such systems will outstrip regulatory endeavours focused on the two decision moments. This paper thus argues that only wide-ranging debate, especially within democracies leading the development of such systems, about the relationship of autonomous systems to the nature and purpose of military violence and underpinning democratic values and principles, can adequately address the challenge presented by the emergence of contextually autonomous weapons.},

Rather than managing forests according to interests in timber, conservation, land or livelihoods, REDD+ encourages forms of forest management that prioritise carbon. While international negotiations are shaping the rules of the programme, how it takes place on the ground will depend on its interpretation and implementation in different places. In this paper, we are interested in how the REDD+ Task Force (Satgas REDD+), an ad hoc body formed by presidential decree to design and implement REDD+ readiness activities in Indonesia, has attempted to mainstream the programme from 2010 to 2013. We develop a governmentality approach to focus on how the Task Force sought to introduce REDD+ carbon rationalities to forest politics. Based on extended ethnographic research, we identify three strategies: adopting and promoting the carbon discourses circulating among global REDD+ communities; making carbon visible and governable through mapping technologies; and implementing participatory technologies to encourage pro-REDD+ subjectivities. In some ways, the Task Force has been successful in building awareness about forest carbon among forest stakeholders in Indonesia. National civil society organisations, in particular, appear to be supportive of REDD+; however, they emphasise 'co-benefits' framed as 'Beyond Carbon', informed by social and environmental justice. For others, however, forests remain sources of timber and land, and new strategies are required if REDD+ is to have substantial impacts on forest governance in Indonesia. The Task Force's efforts reveal the difficult and contested processes through which global climate change programmes come to be embedded in national arenas.},

This triangulation mixed methods study investigated the learning experiences of 152 9th grade students as they participated in an online science-writing project on the socioscientific issue of biosecurity. Students wrote a series of hybridized scientific narratives, or BioStories, that integrate scientific information about biosecurity with narrative storylines. The students completed an online Likert-style questionnaire, the BioQuiz, which examined selected aspects of their attitudes toward science and science learning, prior to their participation in the project, and upon completion of the writing tasks. Statistical analyses of these results and interview data obtained from participating students suggest that hybridized writing about a socioscientific issue developed more positive attitudes toward science and science learning, particularly in terms of the students' interest and enjoyment.

Building on Koch's (2013, this issue) argument for conceptualising closed contexts over il/liberal dichotomies, we analyse how liberal norms of open information, documentation and archiving function as governmental technologies. We argue that immigration and military agencies are not best understood as intentional, conspiratorial agencies bent on obscurity; rather, we show how a range of state and non-state actors produce particular kinds of knowledge about US federal agency practices. By working through examples from our respective research projects, we show how seeking access to state agencies requires researchers' participation in the bounding of state and civil society. Rather than accept those boundaries, we argue that researchers in nominally liberal and illiberal states alike should pay close attention to how governmental technologies of openness and closure are woven together.},

Many theorists have argued that individualism poses a threat to social cohesion and communal association. Other researchers believe that growth of individuality, autonomy and self-sufficiency are necessary conditions for the development of social solidarity and cooperation. Recent research suggests that countries with higher level of social capital (where people believe that most people can be trusted) are also more individualistic, emphasizing the importance of independence, personal accomplishments and freedom to choose one's own goals. In societies where trust is limited to the nuclear family or kinship alone, people have lower levels of social capital. Social capital increases as the radius of trust widens to encompass a larger number of people and social networks, bridging the 'gap' between the family and state.Authors RecommendPortes, A. (1998). Social capital: Its origins and applications in modern sociology. Annual Review of Sociology, 24, 1–25.This article reviews the origins and definitions of social capital in the writings of Bourdieu, Coleman and Putnam among other authors. It distinguishes four sources of social capital and examines their dynamics. Although the original theoretical development of the concept focused on the individual as the unit of analysis, the concept of social capital was later extended to a group level where it became an attribute of communities and nations. The final sections of the article describe this conceptual stretch and examine its limitations.Putnam, R. D. (2000). Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community. New York, NJ: Simon and Schuster.In this groundbreaking book, Putnam surveys the decline of 'social capital' in the United States of America since 1950. Putnam shows how people in U.S. have become increasingly disconnected from family, friends, neighbours and democratic structures and how this decline of social capital may result in the collapse of the society because levels of trust and civic involvement have, as many studies have demonstrated, a significant impact on human life outcomes.Fukuyama, F. (1995). Trust: The Social Virtues and their Creation of Prosperity. New York, NJ: Free Press.In this book, Fukuyama examines a wide range of national cultures to understand and explain the underlying principles that foster economic and social prosperity. He argues that social capital may be as important as physical capital – prosperous countries tend to be those where business relations between people can be conducted informally and flexibly on the basis of social trust or cooperative behaviour based upon shared norms.Hofstede, G. (2001). Culture's Consequences: Comparing Values, Behaviours, Institutions and Organizations across Nations (Vol. 2). Beverly Hills, CA: Sage.Hofstede's book is a must read for anyone interested in psychological, historical, or anthropological approach to cross-cultural comparisons. The book explores cultural differences in values, focusing on the five dimensions of culture, including individualism–collectivism.Allik, J., & Realo, A. (2004). Individualism–collectivism and social capital. Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 35, 29–49.This article gives a comprehensive historical overview of the emergence of individualism and the tension between the individual and the collective. It also explores the relationship between individualism–collectivism and the concept of modernity. The authors argue that individualism in psychology is related not only to the idea of modernization but also to the concept of Westernism or Americanization. In the empirical section of this article, they reanalysed available data on the relationship between individualism–collectivism and social capital within one country (the United States) and across 42 countries. The results support Durkheim's view that when individuals become more autonomous and seemingly liberated from social bonds, they actually become even more dependent on society.Oyserman, D., Coon, H. M., & Kemmelmeier, M. (2002). Rethinking individualism and collectivism: Evaluation of theoretical assumptions and meta-analyses. Psychological Bulletin, 128, 3–72.This article provides a theoretical and empirical overview of individualism and collectivism as cultural orientations. It highlights plausible consequences of individualism and collectivism and provides a guide to the study and assessment of individualism and collectivism based on the past 20 years of usage. It provides the review of the literature on implications of individualism–collectivism for basic psychological functioning such as self-concept, well-being, attribution, relationality, etc.Lukes, S. (1971). The meanings of individualism. Journal of the History of Ideas, 32, 45–66.Being merely a 19th-century expression, the term of 'individualism' has a rich semantic and cultural history, comprising 'the most heterogeneous ideas possible' as said by Max Weber in his book The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism in 1904. In his article, Steven Lukes discusses the various meanings of individualism in different countries and in different schools of thought.Online Materials1.

The current research examined out-group alliance, focusing on predictors of heterosexuals' advocacy for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights. Heterosexuals who were recruited through an online panel of research participants completed a survey containing measures of empathy, out-group contact, gender, education, and attitudes toward gays and lesbians. Additionally, participants indicated whether they had engaged in several allied behaviors (e.g., donating money for LGBT causes). Women, educated individuals, and those with gay and lesbian friends were more likely to be allies. Additionally, alliance was greatest among individuals lower in prejudice and simultaneously higher in positivity toward gays and lesbians. Implications regarding intergroup relations and future research are discussed.},

Increasingly accessible transnational contexts for English language teaching and learning offer new opportunities for local–global learning. This article reflects on a content-based online English course focused on community youth leadership that was offered for Brazilian teens by U.S. instructors and graduate students. The researchers used the backdrop of English learning focused on key concepts to engage students in critical self-reflection, collaborative discussion with peers, and civic engagement with their home communities. This course focused on communication skills, content knowledge, and technology practices needed for young adults to engage each other as emerging global citizens. Students wrote reflections on identity, planned and reflected on community interviews, and designed community-based service projects. The authors describe how students and instructors used a variety of formal and informal communication platforms to experiment with the language and communication strategies students needed to get beyond simple vocabulary practice and into meaningful discourse about contested concepts such as identity, community, social responsibility, social hope, leadership, and beliefs. The authors discuss how students creatively used English across multiple online platforms and geographic borders to reimagine and project themselves as agents of positive social change and emerging community leaders.},

By doing so, the hope is that the ethical implications and acceptability of new science can be more carefully considered and framed in a responsible and democratised context. To explore an example of aspiration in practice, a series of interdisciplinary public engagement events was organised at Durham University under the title New Storylines for Living with Environmental Change: Citizens' Perspectives. In this commentary we report on one of these events, a one-day workshop entitled Responsible Science and Public Engagement, where a citizens' panel aimed to explore ways of conducting deliberative engagement with scientists using the creative arts and a scientific dilemmas café format.},

Cognitive boundary judgements determine observations (facts) and evaluations (values), which knowers appreciate and act in relation to. Werner Ulrich's method of dialogical boundary critique and the framework of Critical Systems Heuristics (CSH) are intended to enable citizen participation in Western democracies through acknowledgement of legitimate competencies in public and corporate dialogues. This paper investigates the application of this methodology in Philippine coastal resource management. The conclusions are based on stakeholder-based action planning carried out between November 2007 and May 2008 in the Babuyan group of islands, bounded by the Balintang and Babuyan Channels. It argues that dialogical boundary critique requires significant adaptation if it is to provide a liberating language for participants in Philippine resource management dilemmas shaped by multiple and conflicting knowledge claims under conditions of significant controversy.

In so doing they tend to distribute their choices maximally across different stock fund categories. It is hypothesised that this reflects the naïve application of a variety-inducing diversification heuristic. The results of two experiments simulating choices of fund categories in the PPS support this hypothesis by showing that participating undergraduates chose stock funds investing in overlapping and non-overlapping markets or industries in a way demonstrating failure to take into account covariation among fund returns. Administrators of the PPS and similar defined-contribution pension plans should provide participants with comprehensive advice on how to diversify their investment.Dans le régime de retraite suédois (PPS), tous les citoyens ayant un emploi salarié allouent une part de l'épargne de leur retraite publique à des fonds d'investissements. Ce faisant, ils tendent majoritairement à répartir leurs choix dans différentes catégories de fonds. On a fait l'hypothèse que cela reflète l'application naïve d'une heuristique de la diversification. Les résultats de deux expérimentations simulant des choix entre différentes catégories de fonds pour le PPS confirment cette hypothèse : les sujets (étudiants) ont choisi des fonds en actions et devaient investir sur des marchés ou dans des branches industrielles relevant ou non du même secteur économique et cela d'une façon qui mettait en évidence leur incapacitéà prendre en considération le fait que le retour sur investissement de différents fonds pouvait être lié.

Based on focus groups and user test material, we elucidate five critical phases that each operate as an obstacle for citizens' further engagement in the digital self-service process: interest, access, comprehension, reflection and support. We argue that these phases and the obstacles they entail illustrate a transition away from a situation in which control and agency over the quality of public services is embedded in a dyadic relationship between citizens and frontline personnel, and to a situation characterized by more complex relations between citizens, the front line, and the digital infrastructure. We argue that this transition implies that citizens are required to possess a new type of competence that contains both financial and digital skills. Citizens who are unable to develop or acquire such competence are likely to be disadvantaged by the services. Lastly, we argue that these developments pose significant challenges for public administrations to ensure the overall quality of the public services.},

Analysis drew on the three core components within the CoP organising framework: domain, community and practice. All three components were evident in building project identity. The domain focused on both curriculum and institutional co-operation. The community was evident for both educators and students.

The article offers preliminary lessons from the ongoing design and anticipated challenges facing this innovative program based on reflections from the literature and project progress to-date. This case exemplifies a form of adaptive governance—an approach well suited to achieving broad sustainability objectives—and for which an early assessment is both appropriate and opportune. Adaptive governance is characterized by governmental collaboration with civil society groups, social learning through public participation, and experimentation leading to more flexible policy outcomes. Early assessment affords the possibility of midcourse corrections, drawing on experience acquired elsewhere. We contend that the approach being developed in Victoria through this pilot program has implications beyond the use of recycled wastewater for achieving various social objectives. It may also contribute to the development of an expansive water quality offset framework applicable to point source discharges, nonpoint source pollution, and sewerage overspills. Moreover, the approach can be applied to design of offset systems elsewhere—with appropriate economic savings and effective application to multiple water quality challenges if potential problems are discerned early.

New forms of networked action and informal collaboration are challenging traditional notions of civil society. Based on the proliferation of new technologies, and spurred by the spread of trans-border delocalized communities and the increasing disillusionment with traditional forms of political organization, civic action is becoming increasingly flexible, temporary, and elusive. This type of nontraditionally organized collective action often stays below the radar of public discourse, unless it is propelled to the spotlight because of international political developments such as the WikiLeaks case (and the related actions by the cyberactivist network Anonymous) and the mass protests in Northern Africa and the Middle East (and the role of social networking tools in these uprisings). In this article, we investigate the interactions and (in)compatibilities of Internet-based networked collective action with institutionalized spaces of policy debate. We begin by characterizing online networked action as an emerging form of organized civil society, focusing on the realm of cyberactivists who are building and using cyber-infrastructure ("grassroots tech groups"). In particular, we examine their values, identity features, and organizational forms. Based on this analysis, we explore two dimensions in which cyberactivism challenges established forms of institutionalized policy debate: the structural dimension and the realm of action repertoires. We ask whether these new forms of civil society are structurally compatible with current multistakeholder governance, and we discuss their repertoires of action with regard to policy advocacy and policy interventions, and thus the level and type of their engagement with governance processes and institutions.

abstract = {A senior executive of Booz Allen Hamilton and co-author of a business bestseller called Megacommunities argues that the United States is locked into an obsolete pattern of dealing with infrastructure investment, even as the country's population growth and technology have raced ahead. Three of America's basic "lifeline" infrastructures—energy, transportation, and water—are nearing the end of their useful operating lives and in desperate need of modernization. U.S. capital spending on infrastructure has been inadequate, amounting to less than 2% of GDP, as compared to 9% in China and 5% in India.But if infrastructure renewal will be costly, money is not the biggest obstacle. History shows that modernizing existing infrastructures tends to be even more challenging than creating new ones because of the drag caused by legacy hardware and the associated human "software." And so the real problems are conceptual, institutional, and political—problems whose solutions demand transformational vision and leadership that will encourage collaborative participation by both the public and private sectors.What is lacking, then, is an oversight and coordination mechanism that restores government's traditional integrating role without creating either new monopolies or a larger, more centralized government. To that end the author issues four imperatives:First is the need to rethink the form and function of our old infrastructures.Second is the need for design principles that make future infrastructures robust and adaptable as technology advances, funding changes, and the needs of our citizens evolve.Third is the need for leadership that succeeds by convening, integrating, and aligning the interests and actions of all important stakeholders.Fourth and last is the need for a national vision for America's infra-structure that defines the function and performance of the entire system over its total lifecycle.A new kind of collaboration by different constituencies, which the author refers to as the creation of "megacommunities," is held up as a way for stakeholders with conflicting interests to cooperate on compelling issues of national importance with a shared set of practices and protocols.},

abstract = {As indicated in the title, many different safety concepts – in the sense of various definitions of "safety" and "safety factor" – have been used in civil engineering and particularly in geotechnical engineering according to the type of project. "The" old safety concept (single) is a fiction. The Eurocodes are based on a common basis, the semi-probabilistic concept, but as before demand different strategies for different tasks. Different strategies for ultimate limit states of failure are now described in geotechnical engineering as different "design approaches".For retaining structures, which include tunnel linings in the broadest sense, the design approach DA 2☆ is the most practical for standard cases and involves the least work in the transition to the Eurocodes. This procedure is also intended as standard in the Austrian guideline RVS 9.01.42 "Tunnel structures in soft soil under built-up areas" in the 2004 issue. This guideline is being revised at the moment, but no significant changes are anticipated in the new issue.Particular features of geotechnical engineering, e.g. that ground can be an action as well as construction material or resistance, have resulted in some special provisions in Eurocode 7. Some of these particular features are referred to in this paper. The application of the Eurocodes in connection with numerical calculations in tunnel construction is also investigated and the limits discussed. The introduction of the Eurocodes is seen as a chance to exploit the experience in all European countries for better codes, unified safety requirements and to jettison ballast.Wie im Titel angedeutet, wurden im Bauwesen und speziell in der Geotechnik je nach Aufgabenstellung verschiedene Sicherheitskonzepte – im Sinn von verschiedenen Definitionen von "Sicherheit" und "Sicherheitsfaktor" – verwendet. "Das" alte Sicherheitskonzept (Einzahl) ist Fiktion. Die Eurocodes beruhen auf einer gemeinsamen Basis, dem semi-probabilistischen Konzept, erfordern aber nach wie vor je nach Aufgabenstellung verschiedene Strategien. Unterschiedliche Strategien für Grenzzustände des Versagens werden in der Geotechnik jetzt als unterschiedliche "Nachweisverfahren" bezeichnet.Für Stützbauwerke, zu denen Tunnelschalen im weitesten Sinn gehören, ist das Nachweisverfahren NV 2☆ für Standardfälle am praktikabelsten und mit dem geringsten Aufwand bei der Umstellung auf die Eurocodes verbunden. Dieses Verfahren ist auch in der österreichischen Richtlinie RVS 9.01.42 "Geschlossene Bauweise im Lockergestein unter Bebauung" in der Ausgabe 2004 als Standard vorgesehen. Diese Richtlinie wird derzeit aktualisiert, wesentliche Änderungen werden sich durch die neue Ausgabe wohl nicht ergeben.Besonderheiten der Geotechnik, z.B. dass Boden sowohl Einwirkung als auch Baustoff bzw. Widerstand sein kann, haben einige spezielle Regelungen im Eurocode 7 bedingt. Auf einige dieser Besonderheiten wird in diesem Beitrag hingewiesen. Weiterhin wird die Anwendbarkeit der Eurocodes im Zusammenhang mit numerischen Berechnungen im Tunnelbau untersucht und Grenzen aufgezeigt. Die Einführung der Eurocodes wird als eine Chance gesehen, die Erfahrungen aller europäischen Länder für bessere Normen, vereinheitlichte Sicherheitsanforderungen und das Abwerfen von Ballast zu nutzen.},

Background
Responsiveness to citizens as users of technological innovation helps motivate translational research and commercial engagement among academics. Yet, retaining citizen trust and support for research encourages caution in pursuit of commercial science.

Objectives
We explore citizen expectations of the specifically academic nature of commercial science [i.e. academic entrepreneurship (AE)] and the influence of conflict of interest concerns, hopes about practical benefits and general beliefs.

Design, setting and participants
We conducted a cross-sectional national opinion survey of 1002 Canadians online in 2010.

Results
Approval of AE was moderate (mean 3.2/5, SD 0.84), but varied by entrepreneurial activity. Concern about conflict of interests (COI) was moderate (mean 2.9/5, SD 0.86) and varied by type of concern. An ordinary least-squares regression showed that expectations of practical benefits informed support for AE, specifically that academic–industry collaboration can better address real-world problems; conflict of interest concerns were insignificant.

Conclusions
These findings suggest that citizens support AE for its potential to produce practical benefits, but enthusiasm varies and is reduced for activities that may prioritize private over public interests. Further, support exists despite concern about COI, perhaps due to trust in the academic research context. For user engagement in research priority setting, these findings suggest the need to attend to the commercial nature of translational science. For research policy, they suggest the need for governance arrangements for responsible innovation, which can sustain public trust in academic research, and realize the practical benefits that inform public support for AE.

Task analysis is particularly useful in assessment and definition of the knowledge, skills, and behaviors that define the scope of practice of a health profession or occupation. Jhpiego, a US-based nongovernmental organization, has adapted traditional task analysis methods in several countries in assessment of workforce education and practice issues. Four case studies are presented to describe the utility and adaptability of the task analysis approach. Traditional task analysis field survey methods were used in assessment of the general and maternal-child health nursing workforce in Mozambique that led to curriculum redesign, reducing the number of education pathways from 4 to 2. The process of health system strengthening in Liberia, following a long history of civil war conflict, included a traditional task analysis study conducted among 119 registered nurses and 46 certified midwives who had graduated in the last 6 months to 2 years to determine gaps in education and preparation. An innovative approach for data collection that involves "playing cards" to document participant opinions (Task Master, Mining for Data) was developed by Jhpiego for application in other countries. Results of a task analysis involving 54 nurses and 100 nurse-midwives conducted in Lesotho were used to verify the newly drafted scope and standards of practice for nurses and to inform planning for a competency-based preservice curriculum for nursing. The Nursing and Midwifery Council developed a 100-question licensing examination for new graduates following a task analysis in Botswana. The task analysis process in each country resulted in recommendations that were action oriented and were implemented by the country governments. For maximal utility and ongoing impact, a task analysis study should be repeated on a periodic basis and more frequently in countries undergoing rapid change in development of workforce policy.},

abstract = {This article describes three service-learning projects implemented in three different ESL programs in the United States. Each description includes typical course goals, service-learning assignments, reflection activities, student learning outcomes, and pedagogical challenges. The first project was developing digital literacy through service-learning projects in southeast Michigan. In this ESL program, two groups of ESL students created two types of written publications about their service and civic engagement learning experiences. The documents were subsequently posted to the Internet. The second project involved international students at the University of Richmond. Students completed weekly service-learning by tutoring underserved children in a low-income urban neighborhood in Virginia. The third project at the University of Denver involved observing how students' attitudes changed throughout the quarter during the process of learning about and serving the homeless community using a series of five written reflections. The three service-learning projects presented in this article demonstrate how community engagement can promote a sense of empowerment in ESL students. This is accomplished by making them feel part of their community, allowing them to work cooperatively to develop authorial voice, increasing their audience awareness in writing, and fostering critical reflection that leads to a better understanding of social problems and civic responsibility.},

There are constant calls for better coordination among agencies, of engaging with the community to improve resilience, of better governance, of community empowerment. Any action in a system affected by disaster will be guided by a complex mix of human response, socioeconomic context, political and power factors, and technology. The technology is only one component in a complex environment. Nevertheless, as this article outlines, recent shifts in the ICT landscape have not only created opportunities for more and timely data, they have opened the way for new ways of working. They have the potential to increase interagency cooperation, they have the potential to deliver community engagement, breaking free from extraction of information to a co-construction of data, and they even have the potential to empower citizens and to enable better governance.},

Discussion highlights selected writings in the USA primarily, writings about art education technology orientations; and then describes the professional experiences and insights of the writer as she embraced, implemented and made sense of technology in terms of her own multicultural educational orientation in a US university. Based on these insights, this writer proposes that technology pedagogy is not actually about digital technologies per se, but about what we intend to do with new technologies in the twenty-first century. Old notions of art as an embodiment of things that matter and a testament to the human condition are now connected to contemporary ideas about citizenship, caring and public engagement. In this trajectory, citizenship education is then posed as central to a future vision of art education in the digitally connected classroom. Caveats and limitations of the educational and transformative power of new global electronic media being set forth in this article are also noted, including paradoxical self-contradictions within the orientation itself.},

We present the results of a qualitative investigation of a complex platform where multiple and hybrid collaborations co-exist and where civil society plays a central role. Based on a longitudinal comparative case study, we draw a processual model describing micro-practices and pathways of engagement. We show that the emergence of these collaborations requires a new type of convener, one that is able to manage the interplay between the sharing/co-creation of abundant resources and the coordinated decentralization of informal authority. Our study extends existing debates on the role of resources and authority, showing the complementarity between possession and practice perspectives of power. Finally, we identified synergies between collaboration and social movement literatures, particularly showing that large-scale collaborations could be mobilized to refine social movement agendas and achieve more purposive collective action.},

This paper aims to shed light on the evolution of the Jewish national language and to discuss the ways in which the cultural trends in Zionism constantly left room for the creative imagination of its adherents, and functioned in such a way as to erode its sacred dimension, thereby promoting a discourse focusing on the individual. My claim is that the Hebrew language case study may reflect the importance not only of national revisionist accounts for our understanding of the Zionist movement, but also the need for an approach that saves a place for truly creative aspects of civic engagement, and recognises the Israeli nation as one asserting, besides its ethnic ties also patriotic nexuses. Special attention will be given to the phenomenon of Hebrew poetry written by women in the 1920s as a platform from which to examine the unique meaning and evolution of language within the Jewish national movement.},
