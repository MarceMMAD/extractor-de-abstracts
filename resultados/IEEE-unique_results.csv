"1","Collaborative refinement of emergency plans through public engagement",2011,"Emergency plans are fundamental for the speedy and effective response in disaster situations. Plans are often constructed by teams of experts, who apply their expertise to define response procedures, but lack part of location-specific knowledge that can be very relevant to make decisions during responses. Such knowledge is, however, in the minds of people who use those spaces every day, but are not involved in the planning processes. In this paper, we advocate for citizens' involvement in emergency plan elaboration via Public Participation, a mechanism long time used in other areas of e-government. We define the steps of a collaborative process for the elicitation of citizen's knowledge via Public Participation. A summary of the results of an initial case study is used to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal for improving emergency plans.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6144775"
"2","Value Lab Asia: A Space for Physical and Virtual Interdisciplinary Research and Collaboration",2015,"Many contemporary research tasks require complex decision making and interdisciplinary collaboration among different groups of experts and stakeholders. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the planning and design of future cities - rapidly growing cities where the development and allocation of energy, housing, transportation and other scarce resources requires the active participation of architects, urban planners, government stakeholders and private citizens. In this paper, we show how recent advances in display technology can facilitate such collaboration and create new opportunities for participatory urban planning. We introduce the Value Lab Asia as a model for collaborative planning and value creation, and show how a multi-screen display management framework called the Tool Library integrates the laboratory's physical and software infrastructure with the planning process.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7272625"
"3","Some Ethical Considerations for Gov 2.0 Using Web 2.0",2011,"The Australian Government has decided to use web 2.0 tools to engage, consult, share, and inform citizens through a program called Gov 2.0. The nature of the resulting collaborations shows that the government's aim is to become more open, participatory and accessible. This will change how those charged with carrying out the policies of the government, public servants carry out its business activities. While there are legal, procedural, social, technical, privacy, IP, policy, and cultural issues our aim here is to highlight some ethical concerns. Though early, it is envisaged that this new conjunction will give rise to additional ethical dimensions (especially role confusion ad conflict) due to the new forms of interactions and collaborations. This paper will examine some of the ethical issues for online participation and engagement using web 2.0 technologies and examine some hypothetical cases and how they might be understood.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6119066"
"4","The applications of Neighborhood Transopoly in public participation decision making",2011,"With the rapid urban development in China, there is an increasing demand for public participation in urban decision making. Neighborhood Transopoly is a kind of GIS-based visualization tool for engaging residents in creating more livable communities. Also it is an accessorial tool for the Public Participation Geographic Information Systems (PPGIS). It is very useful for common citizens to participate in the process of development and regeneration of their communities. However, it has not been introduced and used in China currently. This paper initially introduces the history, development, significance, architecture, applications and case study of Neighborhood Transopoly in detail. And then, we analyze its merits and demerits. Finally, based on the research in this paper, we present the possibilities, difficulties, and prospects of the applications of Neighborhood Transopoly integrated with PPGIS in Chinese large cities.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5980911"
"5","Fostering transparency and participation in the data-based society: A sustainable architecture for a social platform for Open Data",2015,"This paper focuses on innovative solutions to the problem of transparency in Public Administrations (PAs) by opening up public data and services so that citizens participation is facilitated and encouraged. We introduce the motivating principles and the architectural solutions to a Social Platform for Open Data, that is designed in order to provide a sustainable and re-usable framework to provide collaborative and social access to Open Data provided by PAs. Our overall objective is to propose a engage citizens by making them able to socially interact over Open Data, by forming or joining existing online communities that share common interest and discuss common issues of relevance to local policy, service delivery, and regulation. The proposed architectural solution is supporting the citizens in a collective relationship among them (as a network helping each other) and with PAs so that the information provided by the Public Administrations is shared, interpreted, personalized, made easier to understand and discussed to assess its meanings. The results and benefits of our approach, as well as potential impact in the pilot experiences that are planned, are also discussed.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7441082"

"7","Towards a Service Platform and Business Model for Mobile Participation",2010,"In an attempt to bring citizens closer to governments, electronic participation services are increasingly receiving attention. Despite technological advances regarding smartphones and georeferencing, mobile extensions to e-participation solutions are lacking. We propose a generic service platform called mGeoWiki, which will provide a mobile interface for several participation services. Within this paper, we describe the first stages of the design research cycle, describing the problem and an initial proposed solution. We explicitly design the service concept simultaneously with the underlying business model in order to enhance the chances of eventual market success. Besides the instantiated service platform and business model, we contribute to literature by generating knowledge on how to design service platforms and business models simultaneously. Follow-up research will be conducted in a large, multi-university, international research project focusing on design and evaluation of the service platform and business model.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5494853"
"8","Delivering Public Value: Synergistic Integration via Gov 2.0",2016,"The potential of Gov 2.0 to facilitate greater communication, participation, and collaboration with citizens has been debated repeatedly in recent literature. However, Gov 2.0 fails to attract a satisfying level of citizen participation and has not lived up to expectations. Therefore, governments need to rethink how to engage the digital population via Gov 2.0 to achieve public value. To engage effectively, there needs to be a synergy between citizens and governments. The proposed research model in this paper aims to explain the synergy between citizens and governments that is needed to create public value via Gov 2.0. This synergistic interaction has emergent properties to create substantial public value, which is expected to result in many benefits including the increase in citizen participation via Gov 2. The theoretical foundation of the proposed research model builds on theories such as co-creation and public value. The paper concludes by suggesting further empirical research to evaluate and refine the research model.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7427559"
"9","Ageing Well and Learning through Online Immersive Participation Using a Multi-user Web 3D Environment",2011,"The Second Life (SL) multi-user virtual environment offers researcher opportunities to experiment with its rich communication, virtual collaboration, and 3-D content creation integrated tools. The SL synthetic world has already revealed great potential for heritage, education and learning but much of the existing applications made have focused on engagement with digital native audiences. The contribution of this paper identifies the importance of developing and designing tailored virtual places which older members of society can utilize easily and safely within this context, with a focused application of addressing social isolation, enabling well being and lifelong learning. In this paper we also discuss our experiences of introducing SL to an elderly community and imparting to them the skills required to interact within the 3D environment and the resources that we developed to support their induction and training. This paper explores the impact of this approach and signposts next steps in experimenting with the use of SL as a domesticated digital technology tool that offers potential to support Ageing Well in our Information Society. We believe that we are the first researchers to conduct a small scaled pilot study of this kind with two elder members of society both aged over 75.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5962105"
"10","Human-agent-robot teamwork",2012,"Researchers and developers are pursuing increasingly sophisticated roles for autonomous systems. Whether working within networked systems as software agents or embedded in robots and unmanned vehicles, what makes these systems valuable is their intelligent, active, and adaptive nature. These qualities are often characterized in intelligent systems literature by the word ""autonomy""-a catch-all label that highlights the qualities of self-directedness and self-sufficiency in task performance. Though continuing research to make machines more active, adaptive, and functional is essential, the point of increasing such proficiencies is not merely to make the machines more independent during times when unsupervised activity is desirable or necessary, but also to make them more capable of sophisticated interdependent joint activity with people and other machines when such is required. That means autonomous systems must support not only fluid orchestration of task handoffs among different people and machines, but also combined participation on shared tasks requiring continuous and close interaction. HART research seeks to bring together the best thinking from diverse research communities in order to advance current and anticipated applications of intelligent human-machine collaboration, including the participation of humans as first-class citizens in collaboration with autonomous systems. This would enable autonomous systems not merely to do things for people, but also to work together with people and other systems-the inevitable next leap-forward required in autonomous system design and deployment.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6212521"
"11","CIO for governing innovation in information society - case study: Educating Green ITS at university in Japan",2009,"E-Governance, as defined by United nations is Â¿the public sector's use of ICT with the aim of improving information and service delivery, encouraging citizen participation in the decision-making process and making government more accountable, transparent and effectiveÂ¿. It can also be described as the process of forming relationships among stakeholders in order to achieve common consensus for education which can lead to increased citizen engagement and participation, strengthening electronic governance. As a case study, the focus point of this research is on the activities of CIOs for ITS specifically on the issue on transformation of an innovative service platform of e-governance for Green ITS education under the Information/Eco-mobility Society. I conclude that core competencies in CIOs for Green ITS are of prime importance to the development of innovative solutions in various levels of ITS. There are lots of common issues and activities in implementing both engineering and socio-economic programs, especially for strategic plans and contents of services and applications prepared for Green ITS. As innovative CIO, ITS as e-gov public policy for reducing pollution, traffic jam and accidents is very important sector.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5397319"
"12","Big data framework for national E-governance plan",2013,"The world is moving towards digitization. In India central and state governments are steadily moving towards digitizing all the government departments, scheme and services. Due to the awareness of people and availability of network access that emerges, use of E-governance application has increased. As a result data is getting added and size of these data is increasing exponentially day after day - Volume. Semi-structured and Un-structured data from E-governance service like computerization of land records, Patient health records are most often in the form of electronic records. Processing and sharing of these records are difficult by traditional approach - Variety. Defense, crime and police service control the ever-increasing threats of terror attacks and of continually ascending crime graphs. It includes aspects such as creation of- and sharing of- crime-relate real time data - Velocity. Gathering and processing of vast amounts of data is not new. What is new is the speed at which one can process that data and extracting actionable business intelligence or mission critical from messy data - Complexity. Open source big data technology - No-SQL databases, Hadoop and MapReduce are used to handle these large volumes and heterogeneous data. In this paper we present the model that illustrates how big data can result in the transformation of the government by increased efficiency and effectiveness in the e-governance service with citizen engagement in decision making.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6756283"
"13","Developing a Smart City Model that Ensures the Optimum Utilization of Existing Resources in Cities of All Sizes",2013,"The concept of Smart Cities is currently gaining high popularity among city authorities around the world while attracting leading companies to collaborate with government bodies as it is now moving from pilot projects and towards creating high business value. Though the existing literature provides evidence for various attempts made in defining the term Smart City and in developing models for the realization of Smart Cities, they are largely focusing on heavily digitized cities with well-established infrastructure. Therefore this paper attempts to address the unattended need of developing a Smart City model that could equally be applied to small and emerging cities especially in developing countries, with the aim of optimizing the utilization of existing city resources. Maslow's hierarchy of needs serves as the base on which the model is developed and the associated cyclic behavior is due to the emphasis placed on the participation of citizens in city governance through their feedback which is further inspired by the advent of new technologies including web 2.0 technologies. Universal design is integrated to the model further making the cities accessible and livable for all.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6603502"

India is tackling climate change with the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC). The stated objective of this policy is to establish an effective, cooperative and equitable global approach based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and relative capabilities; to identify measures that promote development objectives while yielding co-benefits for climate change. The plan was developed by a special council appointed by the Prime Minister in 2007. The Council includes ministers, government officials, scientists, civil society and business, but has met infrequently. As of 2009, strategies to advance the eight missions identified in the plan are being developed by ministries, agencies and consultants. The need for further stakeholder engagement has been recognised. Many programmes in the NAPCC have been underway for some time, but it is not always clear how the plan will build or expand on these existing programmes. The council are also proposing to revisit many difficult or stalled policy and regulatory reform processes. However, proposed programmes to significantly expand solar power are new; energy efficiency mission implementation involves significant new programmes.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5383191"
"15","Identification and prioritization of stakeholders in the planning process of sustainable development of the smart city",2015,"The article analyzes stakeholders in the city, conducted in order to identify organisations of particular value to the creation and delivery of the sustainable energy policy for smart cities i.e. enhanced Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP). Using the information gathered in the stakeholder analysis, Riga, the capital of Republic of Latvia, has created a stakeholder engagement plan to gather and coordinate the key stakeholders' resources and knowledge for the benefit of the city, and for the development, implementation, monitoring and ongoing revision of the energy policy for the smart city i.e. SEAP. Different approaches to stakeholder communication and engagement planning have been used, based on specific city context, including history of engagement and current plans and ambitions. Riga stakeholders have been identified and prioritised using a matrix tool, allowing stakeholders to be grouped according to their importance for the enhanced SEAP and level of interest or engagement in the city. Riga has completed public consultation roundtables on its enhanced SEAP. Key stakeholders and their groups that have been identified include academia, local and regional administrations, industry and commerce, finance, energy suppliers and citizens. Riga working to engage all relevant stakeholder groups to help them move towards smart city status - including information and communication technology (ICT) partners, innovation bodies and international companies - in the process of developing and implementing the enhanced SEAP. As a result the city is making connections between players of energy, transport and ICT and increasing their role in CO2 emissions' reduction, and recognising opportunities of cross-sectoral actions and transfer of the best practice projects in synchrony with relevant local stakeholders, international companies and banks to roll out innovative sustainable energy solutions at a scale. Gaps in current stakeholder communication have also been identified,- including insufficient recognition of job creation potential by engaging employment agencies, closer engagement with the transport sector companies, ensuring sufficient citizens' engagement, and building on existing relationships with ICT players. Riga has developed communication tools and stakeholder engagement plan based on analysis of the know-how and resources held by each of the stakeholders or their groups and their role in, and potential impact on the SEAP. With increasingly limited local authority resources for communication with stakeholders, usual methods and channels, based on ICT including newsletters, and emails, social media, have been prioritised in order to secure information flow and feedback from stakeholders.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7397229"

The influence of ICT based form of communication on the relations between the authorities and the citizens are heavily influenced by the role of the citizens designed by the authorities. If the citizens are treated as customers the authorities are pursuing a consultative model focusing on creating an effective administration. The flow of information is unilinear; however, if the role of the citizens is a citizenpsilas role the administrative system pursue a participatory model. The information society produces frames of actions for the society, yet it is the role planned for the citizens that create the opportunities for E-Democracy.

Basically, the success of the e-government implementation is depending on the government support and high willingness of citizens to accept then adopt it. User of e-government can obtain benefits such as better access to information, efficiency, citizen participation, reducing cost, accountability and transparency value in delivering public services. In actualizing citizen participation, government can create social media technologies that facilitate two direction dialogue and conversation timeless. For instance, mayor of Bandung city, Ridwan Kamil, who active in social networking sites (SNS) such as Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and Instagram to report and capture what he and his government adjust based on determined programs. Large Bandung citizens follow and enjoy his status, report and photos on social media then become an important factor that influence their intent to use the social media as the main resource to get the government's report. Their intentions then create a behavior to participate on e-government. This way became a breakthrough initiative in attempting an open government as the form of services process in public. Research discuss regarding on citizen participation related to member government social media based on user perspective is rarely.

Initiated by governing institutions or government bodies and non-state actors online consultations differ in goals, approaches, range of target groups, scope of topics and in the use of technical tools. The benefits are clearly recognized, for example online consultations promote the central regulatory objectives by providing the regulator with valuable input from industry members and other stakeholders and help to maintain a transparent regulatory environment. Public consultations therefore help regulators to make knowledgeable decisions. However, current online consultation practice in global area falls short of the potential. Coordination of the online consultation service by common, general purpose tools causes excessive wait times for answers, inefficient communication between experts, limited visibility of document sections and related information, which cause decreased access to public consultations, insufficient number of responses and in general weak participation level. We propose the model of automatic platform for online consultations. Proposed model cover all stages and relevant elements of public consultation procedures. The model is realized as network service and covers complete public consultation life cycle, i.e. starting the discussion, entering associated documents, amendments and comments, section analysis, decision-making and archiving.

Social media technologies now provide local and even non-local citizens an additional means for collective response. By using social media technologies, including Twitter, distributed citizens can generate and disseminate their own crisis-related information to a wide audience bypassing official communications. Researchers have found that citizens use Twitter for information production, broadcasting, brokering, and organization during violent crises [1-2] and natural disasters [3-6]. Although the information behaviors have been analyzed, ethical considerations have yet to be addressed. The dissertation research will focus on the citizen use of Twitter in response to violent crises and the associated ethical concerns of this participation.

"31","Introduction to the Transformational Government Minitrack",2014,"Initially, e-Government was considered a solely technical phenomenon. However, in the last few years, research on this topic clearly showed its multidimensional nature and identified the importance of acknowledging strategic, political, managerial, organizational, and external relationship factors to understand and explain the transformation of government enabled by Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). This mini-track examines the complexity of effectively managing e-Government and its transformational potential. Increasingly, this involves inter-organizational collaboration and the management of relationships with citizens, businesses, and other stakeholders. Transformational government is a rapidly evolving concept focused on ICT-enabled fundamental changes in the structure, functions, processes, and external relationships of government. Although the meaning of transformed government is still unclear, practical examples of transformational government involve innovative forms of public service provision through a variety of digital channels, new forms of back-office integration and joint-up government, digital engagement using social media, and new forms of open government and open public data. The aims for governments around the world to achieve transformational government are multiple and varied: they include increased efficiency, enhanced effectiveness, better coordination across government, good governance through increased transparency and accountability, increased citizen trust or even empowerment, improved public decision-making, and modernizing government.

"34","Experiences in Creating Inclusive Information and Communications Technologies (IICT): Democratizing Software Development in Social Development",2012,"Crowd sourcing, citizen journalism and social networks are Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) that have ushered in civil society's participation in the ICT equation. However, the participation of civil society has been limited to creating content and, to some extent, capturing data about events around the community. An area that has been neglected is the inclusion of these new players in the software development life cycle. Democratizing software development by including civil society in the software development life cycle will increase the variety of software applications and generate more buy-in of applications that improve livelihoods. Such an approach will lead to the emergence of Inclusive Information and Communication Technologies (IICT). The challenges that arise when developing IICTs include, inter alia, ownership of IICT, computer illiteracy of beneficiary communities, balkanized nature of communities in place and the well-known challenge of the communication gap between software developers and user communities. My approach to addressing these challenges was to develop the Integrated Development Spatial Planning Framework (IDSPF), a systems development methodology that seeks to demystify software development for grassroots communities by using participatory techniques that are familiar to stakeholders who implement socio economic development projects.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6597847"
"35","Data Sensing and Dissemination Framework for Smart Cities",2013,"Participatory sensing, which enables citizens to collect and share data, can be helpful to design and develop useful applications in the domain of environmental monitoring, transportation, and health-care. However, the data collection process for such applications involves dealing with a variety of data sources, ranging from fixed environmental sensors to mobile human sensors, generating and presenting data in different formats. The citizens' engagement in sensing campaigns creates additional requirements to take care of their privacy concerns and motivate them to share data. Applications also need to compute the trustworthiness of the source of information to ensure the high quality of the collected data. Consequently, successfully dealing with these issues and deploying an application in an urban environment becomes a challenging task. In this paper we present a framework that uses fixed and participatory sensing to collect data from heterogeneous sources and presents a uniform interface to disseminate data to concerned applications according to their data requirements. We used our framework to develop a participatory sensing based smart phone application enabling and motivating the citizens to report positive and negative urban environmental behaviours. We report the results of our ongoing field trial. One of our findings is that different users contribute information about different environmental issues with different intensity. Moreover, we find that the current user participation to collect and share data follows the power law.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6775064"

This paper aims to explore the usage of public participation in policy making via e-consultations with interested public in central government, namely in two Croatian ministries - Ministry of Science, Education and Sport (MoSES) and MInistry of Culture. This topic is mainly related to the problems of accountability and transparency, but also citizen cynicism and digital divide. Moving beyond this general approach, there is an underlying issue of defining and measuring accountability and establishing the role of e-consultations in the strengthening of accountability principle and framework within governmental organisations. The main problems analysed are the creation of curricula in elementary and secondary school in MoSES and policy-making concerning mainly the distribution of subsidies (establishment of public cultural needs), theaters, and electronic media in the Ministry of Culture. The paper explores the type of comment left on the web sites of those ministries, their quality and general tone, by the means of content analysis, but also the type of organisation and/or inndividual leaving the comment in order to assess the motivation and impact of the coment. On the other hand, it explores and analyses the structures enabling accountability and transparency in those ministries in order to establish the role and potential of e-consultations in strengthening them and possible improvements of e-consultation methodology and practice.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6859815"

These solutions are driven, on the one hand, by innovations in ICT and, on the other hand, to increase the capability and capacity of cities to mitigate environmental, social inclusion, economic growth and sustainable development challenges. In this respect, citizens' science or public participation provides a key input for informed and intelligent planning decision and policy making. However, the challenge here is to facilitate public in acquiring the right contextual information in order to be more productive, innovative and be able to make appropriate decisions which impact on their well being, in particular, and economic and environmental sustainability in general. Such a challenge requires contemporary ICT solutions, such as using Cloud computing, capable of storing and processing significant amount of data and produce intelligent contextual information. However, processing and visualising contextual information in a Cloud environment is not straightforward due to user profiling and contextual segregation of data that could be used in different applications of a smart city. In this regard, we present a Cloud-based architecture for context-aware citizen services for smart cities and walkthrough it using a hypothetical case study.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6424966"

The implication of emerging and future network technologies is that it is now the time to involve every key stakeholder in shaping, reviewing and contributing to the evolution of standards as well as the processes involved in making standards. The success to attaining quality and stability of emerging and future standards hinges on the engagements of the various key stakeholders and roles discussed in this paper. This paper is aimed at helping various stakeholders identify where they fit in the changing landscape of standardization, and promoting further discussions and debates along the topic, since the necessary discussions are not taking place at the pace expected by the global ICT community. We look at the key aspects requiring continued discussions and consideration so as to help accelerate standards development processes and adoption of standards, to help facilitate innovation and new technologies that dramatically bring about changes to the global economy and improve the lives of citizens across the globe. Therefore, it is very important to understand that Future Network Research directions must be aligned with newly launched activities in standardization of emerging and future network technologies.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6162522"
"42","Breathing smarter: A critical look at representations of air quality sensing data across platforms and publics",2015,"The advent of digital technologies have caused cities to become increasingly connected with and reliant upon mobile, fixed, and remote sensing networks used toward urban planning, commerce, governance, and civic engagement. As sensor devices and sensor data become more ubiquitous over time in urban environments, it will be even more crucial to be critical of how sensor data are represented and how to design for optimal legibility for its intended audience. Air quality data, though relatively accessible and open for cities suffering from severe air pollution like Shanghai, China, and New Delhi, India, still pose problems with regard to representation. Data interfaces for air quality sensor data seem to assume or overlook public literacy in environmental standards, sensor calibration, sensor network resolution, and baseline technical knowledge about sensor devices. This paper examines how air quality sensor data are collected and given form across various projects. It will look closely at city dashboards, open data portals, and project-based data visualizations as well as analyze how meaning might be constructed from these interfaces. Finally, the paper will suggest a preliminary research agenda for further assessing how sensor data are represented to publics as cities increasingly rely on sensor networks.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7366185"

Hence, technology can be seen as a panacea. In this regard, a study was conducted to explore Form II learners' view on learning Climate Change with blended learning approach. The theoretical context of this research is underpinned by socio-constructivism. As methodology, an action research was carried out by implementing an interactive educational software, designed based on learners' requirements. A questionnaire was administered to 30 mixed ability learners from a gender-mixed private secondary school with the aim of collecting their learning experience. An active participation of the learners during the face-to-face session demonstrated that through blended learning, they had a clearer understanding and they appreciated the concept with a larger improvement in learners performance. Hence, this active and constructive learning strategy encouraged collaboration and cooperation, and celebrated the autonomy of the learners. Moreover, learners were motivated to take action and address problems in the community, developing their civic responsibility for sustainable development.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7374179"

"48","The view from the other side of smart governance!",2014,"Summary form only given. The different levels of addressing the e-of-things have burgeoned and proliferated in such a way that the exact scale and nature of understanding carried by this e-something has caused a multiple of disarray among not only government entities but among the citizens and every institution that works for social development. This gap of understanding has also increased the impact of any development. Hence the lack of concerted and adopted standards have caused, particularly in societies of developing countries, a widespread of e-democracy, e-participation, e-community, etc. that are of varying levels. One wonders then why in these developing countries which need democracy, collaboration and citizen participation more than all other countries, a dynamic and efficient balance of the politics, socioeconomic development and social societies fail to align into a cohesive power rather than scatter efforts thus minimizing impact and results. I believe a triple helix model to control such forces can be adopted to achieve this end. Certainly political instability and lack of good governance would be difficult to defeat in a short time, but enlisting the true power of e-participation and e-collaboration to transform the majority of the society into a well prepared e-community would quickly develop e-democratic models of operation including e-voting and for that matter “e-prosperity!”.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6819934"

New information and communication technologies such as smart phones and computer-based social networks have great potential to transform the roles of citizens in emergency management. However, current digital citizen science projects are usually limited in three areas: 1) limited one-way citizen participation, 2) no processing and integration of citizens' reports with other existing infrastructure sensing data, 3) no personalized near-real-time spatiotemporal visualization tools for citizens to instantly view aggregated data to gain updated situational awareness. We developed a Mapster application that specifically addresses these issues. First, we leveraged Twitter's geo-referenced tweets functionality to design a customized smart phone application for citizens to report a set of events that have been identified in past urban flooding situations such as ""basement flooding"" and ""powerline down"" etc. Second, a Cloud-based semantic streaming data harvesting and processing tool was developed to fetch and process both the Twitter feeds and other infrastructure sensing data such as US National Weather Service's radar data. Third, a user can instantly explore the heterogeneous data processed and provided by the Cloud service through a map-based spatiotemporal animation tool on the smart phone to see how all the events evolve before, during, and after a storm. Such a two-way information flow significantly improves citizen participation and their sense of situational awareness.

The senior citizen population in New York is notably higher than the national average. The high tech world that surrounds the older adult population relies on smartphones to servers and being connected to the Internet. The elderly have nothing to relate technology to in their past learning experiences, thus find it difficult to incorporate computing skills into long-term memory. Many senior citizens know they have to learn how to operate a computer because the world will leave them behind. The Internet proves essential to the elderly in not only connecting with family, friends, and lost acquaintances, thus avoiding social isolation, but provides valuable health related information and healthcare options. Moreover, research has shown frequent Internet use by older adults stimulates cognition. Other studies have shown technology enriches daily functions and improves the overall life quality of older adults. Older adults are often not comfortable with the swiftly advancing technology. Many older adults feel computers are intimidating and fear breaking the machine, thus reluctant to learn how to use them. Furthermore, many residents in skilled nursing facilities have hearing, visual, and motor skill impairments making computer utilization an immense challenge. Thus, this aged population that has so much to gain from using a computer for email, web surfing, online shopping, and connecting to the world around them are often unwilling or unable to operate a computer.

Intergenerational Computing is an undergraduate service-learning course offered within the school of computer science for non-majors in collaboration with nursing faculty. Students enrolled in the course provide technology - - instruction to older adults as part of their service-learning experience. Older adults receive individualized tutoring in a non-threatening learning environment. Student-teachers assist to overcome the computer fears of the elderly while the elderly learn a new set of communication skills, while being mentally challenged. Other computing courses, including Computer Systems and Hardware, as well as Networking Technologies, contain service-learning term projects in the curriculum. Students select to build computer labs, install networks, and distribute refurbished computer equipment to disadvantaged senior citizens. Some students additionally chose to modify traditional mice and develop prototypes of Nintendo Wii™ remotes to be more accessible to older adults.

Their aim is to integrate information systems technologies (IST) that enables citizens' participation in the initial stages of policy development and the process of reengineering public services. Malaysia aims to be a developed nation and pushing its public service towards the realization of the t-government. After claiming success with several e-government applications that range from information provision to transactional services, currently it overlooks the essential aspect of the t-government that involves citizens' participation in the early stage of policy development as an exemplary of democratic practice. As a developing nation the existence of the digital gap between urban and rural citizens may hinder future plans for implementing t-government. To support future work towards participatory aspect in t-government we seek to gain some understanding of the needs of Malaysian citizens relating to citizen information privacy and citizens' participatory aspects of t-Government. We conducted a survey on 350 respondents from urban areas of Kuala Lumpur and the state of Selangor and also the rural areas of Selangor. The result of the survey showed a strong concern for personal information privacy and willingness to participate for both urban and rural citizens. The result of this study will be a basis for developing the privacy framework in the t-government.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6716737"

They are also increasingly used to drive social action initiatives, either led by government or communities themselves (e.g., SeeClickFix, LoveLewisham.org, mumsnet). However, such initiatives are mainly used for crowd sourcing community views or coordinating activities. With the changing global economic and political landscape, there is an ever pressing need to engage citizens on a large-scale, not only in consultations about systems that affect them, but also involve them directly in the design of these very systems. In this paper we present the UDesignIt platform that combines social media technologies with software engineering concepts to empower communities to discuss and extract high-level design features. It combines natural language processing, feature modelling and visual overlays in the form of “image clouds” to enable communities and software engineers alike to unlock the knowledge contained in the unstructured and unfiltered content of social media where people discuss social problems and their solutions. By automatically extracting key themes and presenting them in a structured and organised manner in near real-time, the approach drives a shift towards large-scale engagement of community stakeholders for system design.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6227089"

Web 2.0, coined by Tim O'Reilly in 2004, is the idea of mutually maximizing collective intelligence and added value for each participant by dynamic information sharing and creation. Accompanied by the Web 2.0 technologies and services have spread around the world at an amazing pace and are used by millions of people every day. Many public service organizations are also adopting Web 2.0 applications as a means of improving their ability to collaborate and serve citizens more effectively. Web 2.0 tools allow governments to develop two-way communication with their citizens. As such, these tools hold the potential for enhancing citizen participation in online government offerings. Blogs, wikis, chat rooms, podcasts, Really Simple Syndication (RSS) and other applications are all part of this process and are tentatively being adopted to accelerate e-Government. These trends also pose big concerns around privacy, security, authenticity, and access that need to be addressed. Government faces cultural challenges as well, including agency hierarchy and accountability issues that need attention. Though it may not be obvious, essentially the road marks in web 2.0 are political: grassroots participation, forging new connections, and empowering from the ground up. The ideal democratic process is participatory and web 2.0 is about democratizing digital technology. From the other end of the spectrum, it may therefore be relevant to ask, if there has been a shift in political use of the internet and digital new media, how do broader the communication of politics and policy making towards web 2.0 impact? Does web 2.0 hinder or help democratic citizenship? This paper attempts to figure out e-government and politics engagement in the context of Web 2.0.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5488529"

First, we defined a large set of indicators of sustainability for urban infrastructure (energy, transport, waste disposal, water resources and wastewater treatment). Due to the complex nature of the sustainability paradigm, we take into consideration two issues, the need to prioritize indicators in order to take better more coherent decisions, and the importance of the feedback mechanism, as an adaptive element that redefines priorities as policies and social engagement takes place. To evaluate both issues, we show four different scenarios, each based on the relative importance given to each key dimension of sustainability: social, economical, environmental and institutional. This approach, we believe is of utmost importance in the determination of public policies, since it is through feedback that law and regulations can better adapt to the circumstances at hand.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5507705"

However, regional local governments have neither the resources nor the appropriate tools needed to understand and respond to the infrastructure needs of older persons. As mobile devices such as tablets and phones proliferate, there is an opportunity to use mobile apps to engage older people more effectively with their local government associations in planning the future of their regional city centres. In this paper we discuss the potential of this application for crowdsourcing older people's opinions as a form of community engagement. The application was developed in partnership with the Local Government Association and the partnership of the two regional local governments who participated in our pilot. We begin by describing the architecture of our platform, addressing choices regarding user interface design, modes and models for data capture, and standards guidelines. We then discuss methods we use for analyzing and visualizing the collected data to facilitate better decision making by governments. Lastly, we discuss the results of the field trials of our platform with mobile focus groups comprising senior citizens in two coastal regional cities in New South Wales, and interpret how our findings relate with the planning and development of these towns. Our work is the first step towards the use of mobile technologies to enable large scale data collection that can lead to smarter and more liveable cities for senior citizens.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6827675"

Notably, it has been actively used during political events such as the recent elections in Iran, Spain and the USA, or the uprisings in the Middle East, to the extent that it is claimed that revolutions will be tweeted. However such claims are yet to be empirically established. In this work we study an extensive set of millions of tweets themed around the 2011 regional and local elections in Spain and their accompanying civil unrest. Our analysis shows that mainstream political entities were overshadowed on Twitter by grassroots movements discussing alternative points of view, at both regional and national levels. By tracking temporal trends we discover an explosion of interest in the Spanish protests following the establishment of the first protest camps in Madrid. The subsequent spontaneous setting up of similar camps in almost every town in Spain was widely reported at the time, and our spatial analysis quantitatively attests that the protests were indeed widely discussed in all parts of the country. Our results suggest that online social networks serve more as media for interactive engagement between grassroots peers, rather than as platforms for politicians to attract mass attention.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406392"

Indeed the lack of security of the Internet and of the devices connected to it results in serious vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities create risks for infrastructures that increasingly rely on the Internet, including not just communications, but also power generation and distribution, air transport, and, in the near future, road transport. It is easy and relatively inexpensive to access cyberspace and to obtain the means of conducting offensive cyber attacks. Thus it is tempting to develop offensive cyber capabilities and indeed some states are doing so - as published in their national cyber security strategies, and several states have allegedly carried out cyber attacks. At the same time, a state is bound to protect its citizens, including against cyber attacks and cyber warfare. This will become increasingly difficult, if not impossible, if current trends continue unchecked. This article argues that international agreements on improving cyber security, and limiting cyber attacks would appear to be necessary and appropriate measures. Yet key developed countries resist taking legally binding measures of that nature, see in particular the discussions and outcome of the 2012 International Telecommunication Union (ITU) World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT). On the contrary, some of these countries practice mass surveillance, which some consider to be a threat to citizens and to the security of states, and which some authors have even considered, figuratively, to be a form of cyber war, even if it is inappropriately justified as a means of combating terrorism. And they resist calls to end mass surveillance.

This trend works by implementing the advantages of community policing and problem-oriented policing, while referring to the strategies of crime prevention initiative, and strives to integrate new forces from the society, such as civilian engagement or market mechanism, into crime prevention. The above-mentioned police administrative model, which combines the forces of multiple “third-parties” to resolve crime problems, is officially called “third-party policing”. “Third-party policing” is a market and community based crime prevention, part of the broader trend of “decentralization of policing”, which means that the police force is shifted from a government controlled institute to a market and community based third party. As the new governing concept supports this shift, including renewal of insurance statistics on criminal concept, and change of perspective towards cautious individuals, we can see many cases of adopting the third-party policing model in security control policies and practical experiences. This article uses the academic concepts of “collaborative co-governance of public security”, “security risks of crime”, and “equality of rights and obligations among multiple parties” to examine how “third-party policing” is used to deal with security control on a practical level in Taiwan. Finally, the article discusses possible obstacles faced while conducting “third-party policing”, as well as what steps should be taken in the future, should the need to use it in the inspection and prevention of crime arise, so as to raise the awareness of government authorities, and allow citizens to take control through participation.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5996307"

Furthermore, as buildings are responsible for a significant portion of total energy consumption and emissions, improving their energy performance is clearly a key factor for accomplishing the EC climate and energy objectives. In this context, the Greek pilot in GEN6, a European Commission funded project, aims to influence the behaviour of the local school communities by raising their energy awareness. As discussed herein, the pilot will provide real-time energy efficiency services over IPv6-enabled grids to the local educational community, providing students with information on their consumption patterns and raising awareness among them on the energy savings that behavioural changes may bring. Consequently, the pilot aims to reduce the participating school buildings' carbon footprint by at least 10% and prove that IPv6 may become an enabling technology for new advanced services. Currently, the installation of IPv6-enabled energy smart meters is in progress at 50+ schools for monitoring energy consumption but also for becoming an educational and social engagement tool for students. The GEN6 pilot, also aligned with the Greek School Network energy innovative programme, is further reinforced by hands-on workshops aiming at engaging students on issues of sustainability and empowering them to make further behavioural energy-saving changes. Results from the competition among the participating school communities are disseminated to the public through various means, such as a web portal, a blog, and social networks, which record the energy efficiency of participating schools and the effect of the actions taken.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6377401"

"90","Keeping citizens, companies, and organizations informed by Web KnowARR",2014,"For the main part, electronic government (or e-government for short) aims to put digital public services at disposal for citizens, companies, and organizations. To that end, in particular, e-government comprises the application of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) to support government operations and provide better governmental services (Fraga, 2002) as possible with traditional means. Accordingly, e-government services go further as traditional governmental services and aim to fundamentally alter the processes in which public services are generated and delivered, after this manner transforming the entire spectrum of relationships of public bodies with its citizens, businesses and other government agencies (Leitner, 2003). To implement this transformation, one of the most important points is to inform the citizen, business, and/or other government agencies faithfully and in an accessible way. This allows all the partaking participants of governmental affairs for a transition from passive information access to active participation (Palvia and Sharma, 2007). In addition, by a corresponding handling of the participants' data, a personalization towards these participants may even be accomplished. For instance, by creating significant user profiles as a kind of participants' tailored knowledge structures, a better-quality governmental service may be provided (i.e., expressed by individualized governmental services). To create such knowledge structures, thus known information (e.g., a social security number) can be enriched by vague information that may be accurate to a certain degree only. Hence, fuzzy knowledge structures can be generated, which help improve governmental-participants relationship. The Web KnowARR framework (Portmann and Thiessen, 2013; Portmann and Pedrycz, 2014; Portmann and Kaltenrieder, 2014), which I introduce in my presentation, allows just all these participants to be automatically informed about changes of Web content regarding a- respective governmental action. The name Web KnowARR thereby stands for a self-acting entity (i.e. instantiated form the conceptual framework) that knows or apprehends the Web. In this talk, the frameworks respective three main components from artificial intelligence research (i.e. knowledge aggregation, representation, and reasoning), as well as its specific use in electronic government will be briefly introduced and discussed.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6819926"

An exploratory factor analysis of their responses suggests a three-factor solution representing motives related to Social Engagement, Interaction with the Website, and Helping. We discuss the place these results have in helping to understand the still emerging picture of the variety of motives associated with various VCS projects and activities.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6479908"
"93","Challenges in participation",2010,"Participatory Design (PD) has a strong tradition in professional settings, including e.g. hospitals and nursing homes. As care and rehabilitation practices move, to a greater extent, out of the hospitals and into private homes a new take on PD is needed to facilitate design activities with patients or laypeople as the primary user groups and to design healthcare applications to be used primarily in the home. This paper discusses challenges and possibilities related to the design of home-based healthcare applications and especially the users' possibilities for participation in creative PD activities. Based upon ongoing design-work, related to home-based rehabilitation of elderly suffering from vestibular dysfunction (dizziness), this paper presents lessons learned and initial outcomes related to patient/citizen-focused development of healthcare solutions for private homes. We present initial ideas on how PD can be used to develop pervasive healthcare applications with less resourceful user-groups such as elderly people suffering from illness.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5482250"

A technology enabled paradigm of everyday ethics in smart cities: Shifting sustainability responsibilities through citizen empowerment",2015,"Conventional sustainable urban development practices are predominantly focused on intervention measures aimed at larger urban stakeholders, providing limited room for citizen engagement. In the emerging context of smart cities, Internet and Communication Technologies (ICT) are becoming technology-enablers of citizen participation towards sustainable urban development targets. This article highlights the opportunity of ICT-enabled citizen-empowerment, based on recent discoveries of behavioral psychology, and raises questions about the accompanying challenges. The aim of such design is to enable citizens to understand their own role in relation to wider sustainability issues, in particular to aid them in decision-making processes. This may result into a transition of increased citizen responsibility that could entail an unprecedented number of daily decisions and ethical trade-offs. To facilitate this transition, the growing stream of ethical considerations in everyday life, ""real-time ethics"", require a distinct interdisciplinary discussion.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7439410"

Understanding what makes such ""hyper-local"" communities sustainable can lead to better technologies for encouraging community awareness and civic participation. However, little is known about how the social structure of such online communities impacts their sustainability. In this study, we conceptualize sustainability through the aspects of viability and performance. We measure three system-level factors that affect sustainability, including network size, connectedness and centralization, which capture the communities' social structures. We test our hypotheses on the longitudinal data collected from E-Democracy.org. Our results indicate that network connectedness and centralization are positively associated with performance but not with viability. The findings reveal a system design dilemma for hyper-local forums. We discuss the implications and potential solutions to overcome the sustainability challenge.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7070107"

Despite of the apparent benefits as online services' immediacy and saving costs, the rate of adoption of e-government is globally below experts' expectations. A concern about e-government adoption is extended to trust issues which are inhibiting a citizen's acceptance of online public sector services or engagement with e-government initiates. A citizen's decision to use online systems is influenced by their willingness to trust the environment and to the agency is involved. Trust makes citizens comfortable sharing personal information and making online government transaction. Therefore, trust is a significant notion that should be critically investigated in context of different E-Taxation models as part of E-Government initiatives. This research is proposing the implementation of Trusted Platform Module as a solution for achieving the high level of citizens' trust in e-taxation.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5561596"

However, social inequalities have traditionally meant that some communities, where there is a concentration of poverty, are both less likely to exhibit these democratic behaviors and less likely to benefit from any additional boost as a result of technology use. We argue that some new technologies afford opportunities for communication that bridge this divide. Using temporal topic modeling, we compare informal conversational activity that takes place online in communities of high and low poverty. Our analysis is based on data collected through i-Neighbors, a community website that provides neighborhood discussion forums. To test our hypotheses, we designed a novel time series segmentation algorithm that is driven by topic dynamics. We embed an LDA algorithm in a segmentation strategy and develop an approach to compare and contrast the resulting topic models underlying time series segments. We examine the adoption of i-Neighbors by poverty level, and apply our algorithm to six neighborhoods (three economically advantaged and three economically disadvantaged) and evaluate differences in conversations for statistical significance. Our findings suggest that social technologies may afford opportunities for democratic engagement in contexts that are otherwise less likely to support opportunities for deliberation and participatory democracy.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6542437"

The noble act of organ donation by donors that at times, has no blood relations has enabled many patients with chronic diseases to earn a second chance in life. The same scenario also takes place in Malaysia in which awareness of organ donation to help parties in need is not new. Many citizen of Malaysia is aware that their contribution gives ""new life"" to the needy. This little “scarifies” indirectly shows that Malaysian people put a high value for the social development in their country. The Malays in Malaysia is the largest ethnic group, but unfortunately, the statistics show that the Malays are the least to sign up for organ donation. Thus, the objective of this study is to identify the causes that prevented them from doing so. This study was conducted by taking into account three factors; religion, awareness, as well as perception or views on organ donation willingness among the Malays. Of the three factors studied, only two significant factors contributed to the main question of why the Malays shy away from organ donation and they are religion and perception. This shows that the Malays are aware that organ donation is a noble practice, but limited perception and knowledge of religion limit their participation. Therefore, it is recommended that a comprehensive discussion among religious leaders in changing the perception and explain the laws of religion on the issue of organ donation is carried out continuously in various mediums so that the awareness of the Malays in organ donation can be fully utilized for the benefit of everyone.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6422959"

In creating a mobile based crowdsourcing application to motivate citizens to report disaster events and experiences, use of keywords and icons should be intuitive, have high recall and make reporting accurate. This paper discusses the user validation results of user interface design through user experience measured by intuitiveness, recall, and accuracy. For keywords, results showed that keywords were appropriate however there is a need to include selection of multiple keywords as well as language translated into native tongue. For icons, intuitiveness score were relatively high for most icons. Icons that had low recognition were because of multiple interpretations. Recall scores increased significantly after training. Enhancing user experience using simulation scenarios increased responsiveness but decreased correct submissions.

"110","Research Article The Role of Leadership and Contextualization on Citizenship Behaviors in Distributed Teams: A Relational Capital Perspective",2012,"Research problem: This study provides insights into the role that a leader plays in improving relational capital, thereby motivating team members' citizenship behaviors in distributed teams. We address the following research questions: (1) What is the role of inspirational leadership in cultivating relational capital (i.e., reciprocity and commitment) in distributed teams? (2) Are team members' citizenship behaviors (i.e., knowledge sharing and interpersonal helping) influenced by relational capital in distributed teams? (3) How does technology support for cognitive and affective contextualization facilitate leaders to improve organizational communication? Literature review: The purpose of the review was to provide a theoretical background for the variables in this study. Based on the relevant theories on relational capital, leadership, organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) and contextualization, this study reviewed how previous studies link these theories to one other, and proposed the positive relationship between leadership, relational capital and OCBs, as well as the moderating relationships of technology support for contextualization. Methodology: The researchers conducted a quantitative survey with 141 respondents in a major university in Asia. The subjects were part-time graduate students pursuing their master's degree. Researchers administrated a paper-based questionnaire along with a cover letter explaining the study's objectives. Responses indicating teams that were situated in only one location and their role as team leaders were removed from the analyses. Participation was completely voluntary. The researchers chose partial least squares to test the hypotheses since it has fewer restrictive assumptions and its ability for analyzing measurement and structural models. Results and discussion: This study highlights the importance of inspirational leaders in cultivating two kinds of relational capital, namely commitment and reciprocity. This study al- o explores the differential values of contextual information from the cognitive and affective dimensions. A key result is that the effect of inspirational leadership on reciprocity is strengthened when there is technology support for cognitive contextualization. At the same time, technology support for affective contextualization has a direct impact on commitment. These findings provide empirical support for affective and cognitive contextualization in distributed organizational communication, and suggest a way for distinguishing between reciprocity and commitment. This study concludes by illustrating the positive effects of commitment on citizenship behaviors, such as knowledge sharing and interpersonal helping. The implication of this study is that when teams are physically dispersed, there should be more emphasis on leadership with inspirational attributes to get their team members to perform beyond standard requirements. In addition, this study provides leaders and organizations with an opportunity to reflect on the appropriate technology that can be adopted to compensate for insufficient communication. The limitation of this study is that each respondent represents his/her working team. As a result, it may introduce bias to the findings. In addition, self-reported measures may also cause common method bias. Future research could consider the addition of objective measures and longitudinal work to reduce the possibility of common method bias, and investigate how work behaviors change over time.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6179567"

The purpose of this study is to define the level of demand of the intelligent environment technology on the elderly. To understand the intelligent environment technology, the researchers reviewed literature, conducted interviews, and focus group discussions with the elderly. The study interviewed 430 participants selected from the elderly population in Taipei. One-to-one interviews were conducted by a trained interviewee using a structured questionnaire assessing personal characteristics and weekly leisure-time behavior. The results showed that the safety is the most important and enhancement of convenience is the least important demand for intelligent environment technology. A safe environment is the most demanding issue for the elderly to participate in recreational activities. Based on one-week leisure behavior, the study divided the participants into three groups: home recreational participants (HR), walking distance recreational participants (WDR), and not regular recreational participants (NRR). NRR participants scored significantly higher on the demands compared to other groups. In conclusion, to assist the elderly in recreational participation, intelligent environment technology should focus on the safety issue.

"127","E-participation in higher education: The importance of non-technical factors as identified in the EU-project MyUniversity",2014,"Many higher education institutes and universities are involved in beyond borders decision making processes. These activities accelerated after Bologna process agreement. E-participation not only covers the general participation of citizens, but also enables higher education decision makers to communicate with each other and with all stakeholders within the university. During more than ten years the EU has funded projects in the area of e-democracy and e-participation in order to respond to this emerging requirement. The aim of some of these projects has been to equip universities with e-participation tools or platforms. There have been some EU projects that turned out to become great successes while some other projects have not been particularly useful. Lots of studies have been published about these projects and the core ideas behind them. But they have mainly covered technical aspects and less about non-technical challenges such as socio-cultural differences, rules and regulations and challenges related to unifying different decision making processes. In the present study an attempt has been made to identify the non-technical factors which have an impact for the success of e-participation in higher education. The EU-funded project MyUniversity has been selected as a case study. It involved 17 higher institutions in Europe. Data collection was conducted by means of recorded semi structured interviews with stakeholders of the MyUniversity project. Data-analysis was done using a systematic coding of audio flies using the Nvivo software and based on grounded theory principles. The emerging main categories of non-technical factors identified by interpreting data have been the major contribution of this study. The study clearly demonstrates that non-technical factors were very influential in the MyUniversity project. The following nontechnical factors were identified as crucial for the success of e-participation in higher education: 1) The socio-cultural context, 2) Id- ntification of users, 3) Usability, drivers and motivation. The study showed that deeper needs assessments locally at each university and ""cultural studies"" are very crucial and should not be neglected, even though conducting them for every single involved country or institution are both budget and time consuming. Moreover, each educational institute should use its own motivational techniques based on their cultural studies in order to involve their users. This study concludes that the ""business strategies"" used by EU for introducing e-participation projects in higher education in EU countries need to be revised taking into account the identified issues.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7043998"

"129","Designing mobile interaction to elicit alternative solutions for participatory decision-making",2010,"Good decisions require good understanding of the problem, the context and available options. This knowledge, in general, is dispersed through several, frequently unidentified, individuals. Collecting, filtering and putting together the relevant knowledge pieces to create solutions are difficult tasks. Many domains fit this scenario of distributed knowledge and creative solution's needs including governmental decision-making. Democratic governments constantly need to make sense of population demands to properly make decisions that attend overall will. However, low citizens participation in government decisions through democratic processes is an aspect that defies democracy itself. Large-scale citizens participation is difficult for the lack of technology to collect, filter and synthesize information. To deal with this problem, we developed an intelligent mobile network that allows broad citizens' participation and feasible government action. Previous research indicates cellular phones as the device with the broadest acceptance in all Brazilian social classes. Sending messages and voting by cell phones are broken barriers to consider the device as the natural input interface for citizen-government interaction. Additionally, message summarization and clusterization help government understand the demands. In this paper we present mGov, a system for eliciting and answering citizen demands in a participatory government structure.

"130","Intelligent system for valorizing solid urban waste",2014,"The management of municipal solid waste is a complex problem for most developed countries. At present, only a few small cities have implemented procedures for collecting garbage in an innovative way. Thus, it is urgent to implement measures that initiate sustainable behavior, with the active participation of citizens, ensuring the conservation of resources through the reduction and recovery of waste. This paper describes the iEcoSys system (Intelligent Ecologic System) developed by the authors. It is a technological tool that identifies the waste produced individually, using RFID tags embedded in rubbish bags - the iBags. When depositing waste, the recycling center identifies and weighs each bag and the collected data is sent to a server system using ZigBee communication standard. When the information reaches the server system, it is inserted into the database management system, making it possible to see the deposited waste in the iEcoSys Internet portal, and even order new iBags. Making the cities smarter and promote sustainability by changing the paradigm of receiving the recycled rubbish instead of paying for the waste produced, is the contribution of this study.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876904"
"131","Issues and Strategies of the Network Political Communication: On the Social-Oriented Construction of E-Government",2010,"Facing the opportunities and challenges of Internet age, Chinese government has initialized the system of network communication with civil society. However, there still exist some notable issues mainly as follows. First, the complexity of Internet information causes the disorders of network political participation. Second, the powers of Internet age are clearly shifted to the hands of technocrats, and thus the substantive democracy of civil society might be impaired. Third, the deficiency of government network construction sets up many obstacles for the communication. Fourth, the ""digital divide"" leads to the fact that political communication cannot represent the public interests. In response to these issues, ""legal guarantee system"", ""network real-name system"", and security mechanism of orderly political participation through network should be established. The government is also supposed to take measures towards the elimination of ""digital divide"". In addition, it is significant to improve the network ability and awareness of government departments, civil servants, and the citizens.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5576643"

A contemporary city attempts to improve the quality of citizens' life and its economy by integrating digital infrastructures with the physical city (smart city). Moreover, citizens in smart cities are playing the centralrole in the majority of eBusiness models that are based onCollective Intelligent decision making applications. However, citizens avoid the participation in such applications by providing data because they feel that there is a risk of correlating their activities and data with their identities. Thus, there is a need to protect citizens' privacy in the territory of a smart city while encouraging them to participate in the establishment of new markets. In this paper, the encapsulation of an ABCs based authentication system in a generic eBusiness model that provides Collective Intelligent eServices in Smart Cities is presented. In the emerging eBusiness Model, the user privacy/anonymity hasa central role which increases user incentives to participatein the establishment of new markets and products in a city territory.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7433845"

Such opportunities have been widely noted, in recent years, in processes like Participatory Budgeting (PB). From the originating practices of PB in Brazil, experiences of PB around the world have been uniquely exercised. While some processes leverage widely on the use of ICTs, others do not. The rationale of utilizing ICTs in PB processes with respect to challenges, benefits and resulted public value-add is still unclear. This has created a wide perspective on whether ICTs should be adopted in the traditional PB processes. This paper investigates the added public value through the use of ICTs in PB by comparing three models of participation in PB - offline, online and hybrid models. The comparison of these models reveals insights and understandings of diverse processes, challenges and underlying rationales of ICT use with respect to public value-add. In order to better understand the impact of ICTs to public value in PB, this paper proposes a framework for analyzing public value-add of ICT use in PB processes. The framework is used to assess ICT use in the three models of PB.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6758858"

"136","Social amplification factor for mobile crowd sensing: The ParticipAct experience",2015,"Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) aims to coordinate and activate the participation of volunteers willing to use their smartphones to harvest large quantities of data as they move in urban areas. One of the most important requirements in MCS is maximizing the effectiveness of the data gathering campaign. In fact, also due to the initial low penetration rate of MCS apps and to avoid making the MCS process cumbersome to users, only a small portion of the whole citizenship can be involved in such campaign, while most citizens are not part of the process. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines participatory and opportunistic techniques to amplify the amount of data harvested from the crowd. The core idea is that people with similar interests, such as employees of the same company, students or friends tend to meet more frequently with respect to people with different interests. Accordingly, it is possible to opportunistically involve in the crowd sensing loop people in the volunteers' neighborhood. Following that main design guideline, our work assesses the SOcial amplification FActor (SOFA) that allows to increase the number of samples retrievable during a crowd sensing campaign. We show the benefits of SOFA by using the ParticipAct MCS platform and we analyze three different application scenarios. Highly realistic simulation results, based on ParticipAct mobility traces, show the advantages of SOFA, with an amplification factor increasing up to 4.45.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7405544"

South African legislation requires citizen engagement, however, the country often experiences poor delivery and “participation” takes the form of protests. Over the last decade, ICTs have been used to address inequalities in service delivery by promoting citizen engagement and enhancing accountability and transparency of local government. The potential of ICTs in this environment has often been met with eagerness, but many unsuccessful projects, with unintended consequences, are examples that the methods of assessing the appropriateness of the technologies need to be revisited. Are we forcing interventions and applications on sectors that are already stretched and under-resourced without questioning the risk? By adopting the Information Value Chain (IVC) approach, this study presents a method to the way we analyse the information needs of municipalities and communities and challenge our own perception of the appropriateness of ICTs as a tool for governance.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7190549"

"141","Secure and Privacy-Preserving Proxy Voting System",2013,"Voting is a frequent and popular decision making process in many diverse areas, targeting the fields of e-Government, e-Participation, e-Business, etc. In e-Business, voting processes may be carried out e.g. in order management, inventory management, or production management. In this field, voting processes are typically based on direct voting. While direct voting enables each eligible voter to express her opinion about a given subject, representative voting shifts this power to elected representatives. Declarative or proxy voting (based on liquid democracy) is a voting process situated in between these two approaches and allows a voter to delegate her voting power to a so called proxy, who actually casts the votes for all the represented voters. The most interesting aspect of this approach is that voters have the opportunity to skip the direct involvement when they trust the proxy to act within their best interest. Liquid democracy and proxy voting has been implemented in various software tools that facilitate the voting process. However, the current systems lack security features typically required by electronic voting systems. Therefore, we present a system that integrates cryptographic functionality and relies on qualified signatures created by the Austrian citizen card to solve the current security issues. This system can support e-Business processes and applications in decision making, enabling the delegation of votes.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6686307"

While the debate regarding the impact of new media on politics is well-documented, few studies have explicitly detailed the process of online civic mobilization in terms of its contribution to the more traditional forms of political participation, including real-world protests. This case study provides a detailed account of how social media platforms, such as Facebook, as well as traditional media forms were used to organize a student protest against censorship. The findings indicate that social network sites provided easily accessible, inexpensive and effective means for civic organization and mobilization. In addition, blogs and forums were used to foster public debate and deliberation on the issue. We also found that the activists used social media not to circumvent but rather to engage traditional media stakeholders and amplify the impact of their messages and actions.","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5718659"
