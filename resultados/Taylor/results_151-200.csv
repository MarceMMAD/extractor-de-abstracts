Reflecting the need for active citizenship so evident in contemporary youth discourse, the grants were aimed at increasing the participation of young people in rural areas. This article discusses two diverse projects resulting from this initiative which were evaluated by academics from University Campus Suffolk. Based in the East of England, each project received a substantial amount of public funding, approximately £600,000 and £400,000, respectively, which brought specific challenges. Each project had similar overall goals: reducing anti-social behaviour; helping young people enter education, employment or training; providing positive activities and increasing protective factors in young people ? such as a demonstrable increase in emotional and social skills together with reducing the likelihood of engaging in harmful activities. This article acknowledges that both projects required a substantive amount of ?buy-in? from existing youth providers and additional stakeholders; however, differing levels of support are clearly evident in terms of actively supporting the overall goals of the projects. Whilst a considerable number of young people engaged with positive activities during this funding round, the lack of community involvement in the management of the projects may have had a negative impact upon local perceptions of young people. Sustainability of projects beyond the funding received was an area of priority for the funders. There is, however, little evidence of success for this outcome. The current expectation of local authorities to ?enable? rather than to ?provide? support is an interesting context through which to explore the varying levels of engagement stakeholders involved in these projects.

We argue that ?civil disagreement? in public dialogue sessions is temporally bound, involves extended engagement in disagreement, and is viewed as productive by group members. Group members use discursive strategies such as challenging through questions, rearticulating claims while acknowledging other perspectives, and editing or reframing. Group members also use silence to demonstrate listening or to indicate their assessment of the situation as finalized.

Six main repertoires were identified: Everyday life, Self-Interest, Environment, Science and Technology, Society and Justice.

Building upon the Media System Dependency theory, this article proposed an analytical framework for assessing such influence. This framework was applied to an ethnically diverse city as a case study, and 15 interviews with city officials and legacy media reporters helped elucidate the ways in which organizational actors might respond to the entry of a non-commercial, participatory local news website. The implications of these organizational responses for shifting the power?dependency relation between the local media and political systems were discussed, and the findings pointed to both promises and barriers in materializing the democratic potential of hyperlocal news websites while calling for more research across different community contexts.",doi: 10.1080/1461670X.2015.1078738,,,

The most radical suggestions involve granting emissions rights to individuals?known as ?personal carbon trading? (PCT). A taxonomy is provided of various proposed design options along with consideration of the previously neglected issue of who surrenders the emissions rights and how this is enforced. PCT relies on an enforcement system in which the penalty level determines the price at which constrained actors will breach the cap. Breaching the cap may require a ?safety valve? option to cap carbon prices at politically acceptable levels. This could weaken the argument that PCT guarantees certainty of the environmental outcome. Enforcement is examined for three sets of actors: primary fuel suppliers (upstream), suppliers of final energy (midstream), and the final users themselves (downstream). The choice leads to very different consequences for the design and political economy of the resulting carbon markets. Although upstream enforcement is relatively straightforward, it would not lead to the strong involvement of individuals in carbon markets. Midstream enforcement could encourage more citizen engagement, but cannot guarantee it. Downstream enforcement through end-users would be administratively complex and is politically unlikely.

To reach community members and encourage participation, planners and public officials rely on involvement from key community representatives. These individuals are often critical to the success of partnerships and act as liaisons between public officials and neighbourhood residents. The purpose of this paper was to examine the role of community representatives in a successful urban regeneration project called the Festival of Neighbourhoods (FON) in Kitchener, Ontario, through which a number of leisure-related projects have been funded. Two major themes were identified that focussed on the role of community representatives. First, relationship with the City, centred on community representatives' perceptions of the City's willingness to remain flexible and open to decisions. Second, relationship with the neighbourhood, focussed on the role of community representatives to build a relationship with neighbourhood residents to encourage involvement and create a sense of commitment to the FON. Increasing emphasis has been placed on involving community members in the decision making and program implementation process.

The behaviour of this group ranged from constructive collaboration through participation in government to outright violent clashes with the state. Such dramatic changes expose the link between changing levels of bifurcated loyalty and political behaviour in response to changes in state policies towards religious actors and contents. The paper concludes with a brief discussion about the general applicability of such an approach to the study of religious groups in democratic politics and civil society.",doi: 10.1080/09637494.2014.887358,,,

This is most vividly demonstrated in the tendency of Chinese consumers to engage in the practice of self-health, an integral dimension of the wide-spread yangsheng (life-nurturing) practice at the grassroots level. Engaging with the concept of biocitizenship, and combining critical analysis of media with ethnographic fieldwork, this paper examines a nationwide process of health literacy education through popular media and the ways in which this process shapes yangsheng as both discourse and practice. It also identifies a range of ethical positions adopted by individual citizens in response to yangsheng as a discourse, practice and industry. The discussion reveals that biological citizenship has indeed become a new and integral dimension of China's citizenship project in the twenty-first century.

These techniques are based on two key assumptions: that experiences change attitudes and that changes in behaviour will follow changes in attitudes. Yet the effectiveness of these newer techniques and the accuracy of the assumptions on which they are based remain largely untested.

Drawing on interviews with the senior management of nuclear organisations, the analysis shows that organisational risk perception is not merely a human construct or the outcome of simple technical cost-benefit rationalities. It is the result of interactions between material and ideational conditions of risk.
