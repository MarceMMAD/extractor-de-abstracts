Use of Web information technologies have been encouraged in an effort to create more back-and-forth communication between citizens and their government. These ""Civic Participation 2.0"" attempts to open the government up to broader public participation are based on three pillars of open government---transparency, participation, and collaboration. Thus far, the Administration has modeled Civic Participation 2.0 almost exclusively on the Web 2.0 ethos, in which users are enabled to shape the discussion and encouraged to assess the value of its content. We argue that strict adherence to the Web 2.0 model for citizen participation in public policymaking can produce ""participation"" that is unsatisfactory to both government decisionmakers and public participants. We believe that successful online civic participation design must balance inclusion and ""enlightened understanding,"" one of the core conditions for democratic deliberation. Based on our experience with Regulation Room, an experimental online participation platform trying to broaden meaningful public engagement in the process federal agencies use to make new regulations, we offer specific suggestions on how participation designers can strike the balance between ease of engagement and quality of engagement---and so bring new voices into the policymaking process through participating that counts."

These sites represent the first step in what looks to be a growing online phenomenon: social data analysis, that is, collective analysis of data supported by social interaction. Engaging crowds of both experts and non-experts in the process of data exploration has applications ranging from political transparency to business intelligence to citizen science. Achieving this vision, however, will require further innovation in the design of systems for collaborative data management.In this talk, I will highlight recent efforts to use the web as a platform for collectively creating, managing, and analyzing data. I will share how web citizens are collaborating with data, and discuss how we might design systems to catalyze social forms of data management and exploration."

The application serves 2 major roles: First is to collect and visualize data on road surface conditions in Nairobi. Second role is as a citizen engagement platform to raise awareness on the state of road conditions in Nairobi using Twitter hashtags. The focus of this work is to discuss how AYB is employed to promote citizen engagement. Nairobi is one of the most active cities in East Africa in terms of Twitter usage. This guided our decision to employ Twitter as a social engagement tool. The demand for more systematic citizen engagement and public participation in the governance of developing cities is growing. As government budgets are becoming increasingly tight, new ways of addressing road maintenance problems are required. Public governance in developing countries faces accountability issues that allow corruption and poor service delivery to seethe. Lack of information and citizen engagement perpetuates such tendencies. We propose Afya Ya Barabara as an engagement platform that will expand the capacity of municipalities and its citizens to better monitor road conditions using mobile technology."

The conference was organized under the patronage of the Ministry of Security and Public Administration of the Republic of Korea (MOSPA) by the National Information Society Agency and by Macao-based Center for Electronic Governance at United Nations University International Institute for Software Technology (UNU-IIST) as the founder and organizer of the ICEGOV series. The conference took place under the theme ""Beyond 2015  Smart Governance, Smart Development"". It was co-located with the Global e-Government Forum, organized by MOSPA in collaboration with United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA).The ICEGOV series focuses on the use of technology to transform relationships between government and citizens, businesses, civil society and other arms of government (Electronic Governance). Established in 2007, the series looks beyond the traditional focus on technology-enabled transformation in government (Electronic Government) towards new forms, new paradigms, and new foundations for technology-enabled governance, collaboration and sustainable development. ICEGOV is a platform where researchers, policy-makers and practitioners meet; a platform where theories are tested, insights are shared and experiences are reported; a platform for network- and capacity-building where keynote lectures and paper sessions are complemented by plenary discussions, town hall debates and poster exhibitions; a platform for international dialogue attended by participants from developing, developed and transition countries, from the United Nations system, and from many academic, governmental, non-governmental and private sector organizations. Since its establishment, the series has traveled globally from Macao (ICEGOV2007), through Cairo (ICEGOV2008), Bogota (ICEGOV2009), Beijing (ICEGOV2010), Tallinn (ICEGOV2011) and Albany (ICEGOV2012), to Seoul (ICEGOV2013) all generating significant local interest and stakeholder engagement.The program of ICEGOV2013 was built upon contributions from researchers and practitioners from around the world. In response to the call for papers, the conference received 133 papers from 54 countries and economies. The papers were evaluated in five categories: 1) Completed Research Papers  providing the outcomes of complete research in one or more aspects of EGOV, with proven capability to advance the state of research in the field, limited to 10 pages; 2) Ongoing Research Papers  providing the outcomes of ongoing research in one or more aspects of EGOV, with potential capability to advance the state of research in the field, limited to 4 pages; 3) Completed Experience Papers  describing completed experience concerning EGOV policy or practice innovations, with proven capability to advance the state of practice in the field, including critical success factors and insights on the challenges encountered and how they were addressed, limited to 10 pages; 4) Ongoing Experience Papers  describing ongoing experience concerning EGOV policy and practice innovations, with potential capability to advance the state of practice in the field, including critical success factors and insights on the challenges encountered and how they are being addressed, limited to 4 pages; and 5) Poster Papers  presenting novel ideas and initiatives with potential to advance the state of research or state of practice in the field, limited to 2 pages. In total, 43 Completed Research Papers, 45 Ongoing Research Papers, 17 Completed Experience Papers, 21 Ongoing Experience Papers and 8 Posters were received. After anonymous peer-review process carried out by the members of the Program Committee at least three independent reviews were obtained for each submission as a basis for acceptance decisions: 13 submissions were accepted as Completed Research Papers, 8 as Completed Experience Papers, 29 as Ongoing Research Papers, 11 as Ongoing Experience Papers and 21 as Poster Papers. All accepted submissions, revised to address review comments, and presented at the conference within 6 paper tracks, 11 thematic sessions and one poster session, are included in this volume. Among them, like the last three ICEGOV conferences, the authors of selected papers were invited to submit extended versions of their papers for possible publication in the special issue of Government Information Quarterly, Elsevier.Based on the submitted and invited contributions and continuing the ICEGOV tradition, ICEGOV2013 featured a rich academic, capacity-building and network-building program comprising keynote lectures, plenary discussions, town hall debates, paper tracks, thematic sessions and the doctoral colloquium and poster exhibition. The program engaged individuals from over 60 countries and economies as authors, reviewers, committee members or resource persons.

At the same time, new instruments and mechanisms are being introduced into the organization of civic engagement. Most of them are associated with the development of the Internet, which facilitates communication between members of civic activism.One of these mechanisms is web applications for civil action. These applications make it possible to bring together an unlimited number of persons in order to deal with a variety of social problems. In this respect, it is important to research this form of civic engagement, which is developing in modern Russia and proving to be so effective. Therefore, the aim of this research is to analyze the effectiveness of such web applications in the process of solving problems both on the level of society as a whole and for individual citizens. The analysis of individual applications allows us to reveal the advantages of this kind of cooperation in solving social problems. We propose to evaluate the effectiveness of web applications as a facility of their service to reduce the transaction costs in the search for and analysis of information, and the identification and assessment of possible alternatives in the process of solving both on the level of society as a whole and for individual citizens.In this paper we analyze three major web applications: ""Tak prosto!"" (""So easy!""), ""Nepofigizm"" (""Unindifference""), ""Tak-tak-tak..."" (""Tut tut tut""). Scrutinizing some quantitative indicators, we explore how they operate. These indicators include: website traffic, the number of users involved in social networks, the number of views of discussions and videos created by the web application, and regional coverage. We have used the case-study method with some event-analysis to collect and analyze the data.It is possible to determine the attractiveness and relevance these applications as tools for citizens in solving various problems. Primarily, it must be identified as a new form of cooperation between citizens and non-profit organizations for solving social problems. Taking into account the demand for civic web applications, the ability to significantly reduce the transaction costs of solving the problems of citizens, as well as the growth of users of these web applications, we can speak about the effectiveness of civic applications in Russia."

It not only serves as an accountability mechanism for key local institutions but also enhances communities' problem solving skills by setting important agendas and opening public discussions. However, the Internet is posing serious challenges to local news outlets that lead to a significant reduction of accountability reporting and decreasing revenue. In this paper, we study the challenges and opportunities of local journalism in online communication space. We first observe the status of local journalism in online discourse by analyzing the public attention to local news outlets. Using Twitter to capture online public discourse, the study provides a large-scale quantitative analysis of the public's attention to local journalism. We also explore the potential to promote local journalism with information systems through a real deployment study. We propose a context-specific, decision-oriented design approach for local journalism, and evaluate it using Informed Citizen, a web portal to local journalistic contents of electoral districts."

Based on observations, participant interviews, and a focus group with representatives from the local government authority, the contribution of this research is twofold. First, we propose five elements to guide the design of digital pop-up interventions for community engagement. Second, we demonstrate the effectiveness of combining digital interfaces and a physical pop-up within a civic space equipped with a large urban screen to engage wider cross-sections of the public. From that, we derive insights about the utilisation of this approach in attracting the attention of people who do not generally attend traditional community engagement events, and provide a more seamless consultation process by enabling citizens to submit their responses on the spot."

The screen facilitated a feedback platform about a concrete urban planning project by promoting specific questions and encouraging direct, in-situ, real-time responses via SMS and twitter. This new mechanism offers additional benefits for civic participation as it gives voice to residents who otherwise would not be heard. It also promotes a positive attitude towards local governments and gathers information different from more traditional public engagement tools."

The availability of innovative platforms for online political participation has led to increasing use of internet voting in the last five elections, while they have consistently failed to engage public in the legislative process. Furthermore, the internet voting can be seen as transactional. It has not made substantial contribution to online democratic participation other than making voting more convenient for certain segments of society. The government portal for encouraging citizens to express their views about new laws suffers from both unwillingness of citizens to participate and most ministries to make new laws available."

ICEGOV is a platform where researchers and practitioners meet, a platform where: theories are tested, insights are shared and experiences are reported. It is a platform for network- and capacity-building: the keynote lectures and paper sessions are complemented by tutorials, thematic sessions and discussion panels. It is also a platform for development, attended by participants from developing and transition countries, from the United Nations, and from a range of governmental and non-governmental organizations. Since its establishment, the series has traveled globally from Macao SAR (ICEGOV2007), through Cairo (ICEGOV2008), Bogota (ICEGOV2009), Beijing (ICEGOV2010), to Tallinn (ICEGOV2011), all editions generating significant local interest and stakeholder engagement from both practitioners and academics."

They are also increasingly used to drive social action initiatives, either led by government or communities themselves (e.g., SeeClickFix, LoveLewisham.org, mumsnet). However, such initiatives are mainly used for crowd sourcing community views or coordinating activities. With the changing global economic and political landscape, there is an ever pressing need to engage citizens on a large-scale, not only in consultations about systems that affect them, but also involve them directly in the design of these very systems. In this paper we present the UDesignIt platform that combines social media technologies with software engineering concepts to empower communities to discuss and extract high-level design features. It combines natural language processing, feature modelling and visual overlays in the form of ``image clouds'' to enable communities and software engineers alike to unlock the knowledge contained in the unstructured and unfiltered content of social media where people discuss social problems and their solutions. By automatically extracting key themes and presenting them in a structured and organised manner in near real-time, the approach drives a shift towards large-scale engagement of community stakeholders for system design.

Using new technologies, especially social media technologies, to fulfill the mandate of this directive provides an opportunity for governments to engage citizens in new ways and create innovative collaboration models. However, it also increases levels of risk and uncertainty due to the complexity of implementing technologies that are not yet well understood in substantially new government contexts.

Increasingly, libraries fulfill this role. Instead of direct government-to-user interaction, information channels flow from agency to librarian to user, from user back up to agency, and from agency to user to librarian. This paper expands on the idea of these multiple pathways of information through research conducted in collaboration with libraries, government agencies, state library agencies, and a national library association in the United States with aims to create an e-government web resource to assist librarians engaging in e-government services. The different pathways of information both informed the creation of the web resource and offered a practical model of e-government, important for other projects dealing with similar information."

People used multiple tools through which they: were serendipitously exposed to diverse political information, constructed diverse information feeds, disseminated diverse information, and engaged in respectful and reasoned political discussions with diverse audiences. When people's civic agency was inhibited when using a tool, they often adopted, or switched to, alternative media that could afford what they were trying to achieve.

We conducted 90 semistructured interviews with Iraqi civilians who experienced the 2nd Gulf War beginning in March 2003. We show how citizens used ICTs to continuously resolve breakdowns in infrastructure during ongoing disruption caused by the conflict, by creating new, reliable technology-mediated social arrangements that enabled people to maintain daily routines for travel, education, and obtaining information. We then discuss new ways to think about infrastructure and implications for the disaster relief effort."

Accordingly, appropriate methods and tools for successful open and collaborative public governance and public policy making supported by innovative ICT are increasingly becoming important. Along the demands for the implementation of good governance principles and the adoption of open government, policy officials need concise and reliable information to conduct policy making in an efficient and effective way. Likewise, the engagement of the citizenry as well as of civil society organisations (CSOs) and of representatives of the business and voluntary sectors have become imperative. In an international and inter-disciplinary researcher network called eGovPoliNet, scholars have developed visionary scenarios to envisage how ICT-supported open and public governance and policy making might emerge in the years to come. We used scenario building as a method to get insights into potential alternative futures in a certain area. The scenarios sketched the interactions, environment, technological developments and other relevant aspects of potential futures of ICT-enabled public governance and how policy modelling could be deployed thereby. From initial 19 scenarios formulated, a final set of six scenarios has been consolidated and exposed to a wider group of experts. Next step in this process is to develop a range of grand challenges and research directions in this field."

Firstly, it discusses the emergence of pro-elite and protest networks, which aim to mobilize political participation during the electoral period. Secondly, it explores the evolution of such networks within 18 months and offline activity, which is determined by contention on social media. In our survey, we take the pro-elite and protest segments of the Russian social network, ""Vkontakte"", as an object of analysis. We use network analysis to examine how the network appeared and occurred during the electoral period, as well as how such networks have changed 18 months later. The study of the transformations of the protest segments showed a significant shift in civic engagement. One and a half years after the electoral cycle of 2011–2012, the network protest groups institutionalized in NGOs or, at least, in the civil initiatives of different areas: election observation, anti-corruption activity and local issues, etc."

This is a huge and complex societal problem. Despite the multi-faceted nature of the problem, we propose that HCI researchers can still make a positive contribution in this space through the design of technologies that support citizens to engage with issues of surveillance. In this paper we describe the design of a messaging application called Captchat. Captchat enables people to send everyday messages embedded into images, with the added ability to apply visual distortions to the message to resemble an online CAPTCHA. We propose the chief benefit would be that Captchat messages (with potentially ""one-time"" distortions) can increase the difficulty for algorithms to index private messages and necessitate the involvement of much more costly human labor in the surveillance process. We developed a prototype and conducted a user study; the results suggest that people were likely to create Captchat messages that were difficult to index for an OCR package but still easy to understand by humans, even without explicit instructions to interact 'securely' with the application. While more work is still required to understand the limitations of Captchat, we hope it can open discussion on how HCI researchers can respond to the challenges faced from ubiquitous surveillance."

During a two-weeks workshop with Master students at the Dept. of Industrial Design at the Eindhoven University of Technology, we developed six different interactive Engagement Probes: open, creative and playful tools aimed at engaging people in a design process more concrete and effective than a brainstorm session. These Engagement Probes have been validated in a five-hour workshop Hephaestus and the Senses, in which 80 participants from different background have used them as a mean to ignite their design process. Every team started to meet and getting to know each other in a playful way using their bodies through one of the Engagement Probes. Thereupon, they designed and prototyped in teams of 4-6 persons, an artefact for citizens to socially connect through their senses. The results of the workshop show that the Probes stimulate engagement, help people to get familiar and connect in a short period of time, and inspire and boost a design process with an emphasis on embodiment and tangibility (Trotto and Hummels, submitted)."

Earth observation and monitoring capabilities are only as good as their ability to reach those in harm's way and inform those who must respond when disaster strikes. At the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), our scientists work on many different natural hazards across the US and around the globe in close collaboration with federal, state and academic partners. We support monitoring networks, generate hazard assessments, and study the natural processes and societal factors that shape the risks we face from hazard events.The USGS has delegated federal responsibility to provide notifications and warnings for geologic hazards, including earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and landslides. For a number of other hazards, USGS monitoring capabilities support the statutory responsibilities of our partners. Data from USGS national and global seismic networks are fed directly to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tsunami warning centers. USGS streamgages and storm-surge monitors support NOAA's flood and severe weather warnings, including those for hurricanes. The USGS maintains a network of 14 geomagnetic observatories around the US and its territories, which are used by NOAA and the U. S. Air Force to measure the intensity of geomagnetic storms caused by solar flares and other space weather.For earthquakes, the USGS Advanced National Seismic System generates situational awareness tools that include e-mail and text alerts to over 300,000 subscribers worldwide and the Prompt Assessment of Global Earthquakes for Response (PAGER) system's rapid estimates of fatalities and economic losses to help focus and prioritize response. Disaster information has increasingly become a two-way flow thanks to crowdsourcing and social media. The USGS actively engages with the public, who report on what they experienced through our Did You Feel It website. Tens of thousands of these reports come in after widely felt earthquakes, and that citizen science information is then used to augment instrumental data to refine impact estimates.For volcanoes, the USGS is modernizing and expanding its monitoring capabilities through the National Volcano Early Warning System. Common nationwide alerts and notifications characterize the threats to aviation and nearby communities due to unrest and eruptive activity at the 169 active U. S. volcanoes. For landslides, a prototype debris-flow warning system has been established in southern California in partnership with NOAA with plans to expand up the West Coast.USGS geospatial information supports response operations for wildfires and many other types of disasters. The web-based GeoMAC application provides fire managers and increasingly the public with current geospatial information on the status, location, and proximity of wildfires to natural resources, property, and infrastructure. Through its Hazard Data Distribution System, the USGS coordinates the acquisition and provision of satellite imagery and authoritative geospatial information for use in disaster preparations, rescue and relief operations, damage assessments, and reconstruction efforts.Millions of people worldwide look to USGS for rapid, reliable hazard information, either directly or through our partners. We are continually looking for ways to innovate in the face of ever-increasing expectations to deliver the right information to the right people at the right time."

Researchers at Clemson University, collaborating with resources managers, educators and teachers initiated the Vanishing Firefly Project to engage citizen scientists with the following goals: (1) Science Inquiry-Engage citizens in scientific practices to understand the impacts of urbanization on environmental quality; (2) Service Learning-Increase the skill of citizens in making critical, scientific and informed decisions through community and service activities; (3) Sustainability-Protect natural habitats through effective land and resource management practices and (4) Stewardship-Provide opportunities for citizens to participate in environmental and sustainability studies and activities.The project began in 2010, and was initially a Field Day located in Georgetown, South Carolina, USA. Since then, the project has grown from a single day event, to a statewide field survey, and now a global event in 2014. The 2010 efforts were local and to realize our goals would require increasing citizen science participation from one location in South Carolina to a regional scale. Several issues were to be addressed that varied from technology development, data quality and management, citizen scientist training and motivation for volunteers. Our initial technology framework consisted of a single Google Docs webform that allowed users to submit their firefly counts, but we had no ability to engage volunteers during and after the initial submission. The technology framework at this time (2014) now consists of an iOS app, Android app and a webform that submit firefly counts, firefly behavior, ambient light measurements (iOS and Android app only) and habitat type to a real-time reporting and geospatial data management system. Our efforts have leveraged social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to support training, education and engagement.

While the technological dimension has been widely studied, the motivational dimension received little attention to date. To address this gap, we surveyed volunteers at Stardust@home a digital citizen science project, in which volunteers classify online images from NASA's Stardust spacecraft. We found that collective and intrinsic motivations are the most salient motivational factors, whereas reward motives seem to be less relevant. We also found that intrinsic and norm-oriented motives are most strongly associated with participation intentions, which were, in turn, found to be associated with participation effort.

Previous work on the Drug War has documented the use of social media for real-time reports of violent clashes. However, VXM goes one step further by taking on a pro-militia propagandist role, engaging in two-way communication with its audience.

Due to that we have attempted to use 3D digital technology related to Web-based Virtual Reality to support learning and teaching actions in the context of K-12 Education.In this paper, we present educational actions that we have carried out for improving K-12 children and educators' digital literacy with focus on ongoing work developments and results.We have achieved qualitative results, showing an enormous potential for stimulating individuals' motivation/will and development in places under social and economic disadvantage. The results have been reached through computer supported collaborative and interdisciplinary learning experiences; young children's cognitive and technical skills development for using Web-based Virtual Reality tools and techniques with autonomy; including basic and higher education collaborative work.We have observed an increase on individuals' engagement with technology, which has supported ones' sustainable knowledge based interactions and technical skills improvements in diverse contexts. Citizens' technical knowledge domain has brought about ones' awareness and cultural transformation related to use information and communication resources better as lifelong learning companion as well as approximating individuals from arts, culture, science and contemporary technology."

These online systems could be places for rich policy relevant debate, which is favored by scholars of deliberative democracy. Alternatively, social media might be a platform for an identity driven form of political discourse that is routinely scorned by scholars of democracy. To examine these two possibilities, we analyzed tweets sent during three national elections, the defining participatory process of democracy. Our dataset includes over 760,000 tweets gathered during national elections in Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya from 2011 to 2013. In order to analyze the degree to which Twitter was being used for policy relevant discussion we developed policy term sets through a text analysis of the major political party platforms. To examine the amount of discourse focused on identity issues we created identity term sets based upon national religious, tribal, and regional differences. In Nigeria, where divisive identity politics feed violence and electoral misconduct, discussion of tribe, region, and religion dominate mentions of platform policies. In contrast Ghanaians, who enjoy the most robust democracy of the three countries, were seven times more likely to discuss policy issues rather than identity. Kenyan democracy is still undergoing consolidation, and tweets again reflect this, with almost as many tweets devoted to tribal identity as campaign policy. These findings suggest that social media discussions may echo the state of democratic deepening found in a country during its national elections."

A common assumption is that money and ICT are the ideal solutions to issues of data quality and participant engagement. The reality is instead that resource limitations often require adopting suboptimal ICT, including tools that are ""free as in puppies"" with hidden costs from poor usability and lack of appropriate functionality.A comparative case study of three citizen science projects, eBird, The Great Sunflower Project, and Mountain Watch, found that projects with few ICT resources employed a broader range of strategies to address these issues than expected.

In order to empower youth in a largely immigrant and lower-income neighborhood, we designed a location-based storytelling and story experiencing system for web-enabled mobile phones. The system is based on a novel concept of pervasive play where stories emerge and develop on several dimensions -- most notably for our design a geographical one. This system functions as a research instrument in this paper. Through a qualitative analysis of the comments made through the system, we find (1) memories, feelings, and attitudes to be prime means of expression for youth, (2) the expression of such personal emotions leading to civic discussions, and (3) such discussions expanding over geographic areas in the neighborhood. Consequently, we argue for an approach to locative civic engagement systems that takes a vantage point in youth's emotions rather than a very rational and dry approach to deliberation."

While this intersection is exactly where a new form of democratic participation could develop, the three traditions were, nonetheless, far from easily combined in the specific cases. The challenges that we have identified are to: Identify win-win situations, rather than to maximize participation; to work with motivation for long-term projects across municipality and communities; to identify and work with early movers, and not just representative citizens; and to create space for local municipal agencies to develop bottom-up technological solutions. The multiplicity of co-existing traditions of involvement need more focus in the future development of participatory design."

It also seeks to ensure efficiency, transparency, and reliability of such services at affordable costs. A huge nationwide ICT infrastructure comprising of more than one lakh Common Service Centres (CSCs) for approximately six lakh villages, Statewide Area Networks (SWAN) for network connectivity to the lowest administrative levels, and State Data Centres (SDCs) for hosting state level e-Governance applications and data are thus being set up. Government departments, like, Land Records, Police, Property Registration, Agriculture, Employment, Watershed Management, Disaster Management, and local level elected bodies like Panchayats (village clusters) and Municipalities etc. involving geographic information, geo-spatial data and processing tools assume significance.Taking note of this requirement, the Natural Resources Data Management System (NRDMS) programme of Department of Science & Technology (DST), Government of India aims at setting up Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) and developing a suite of web-accessible geo-spatial data processing tools. The SDIs and the tools are expected to provide information support to the efficient delivery of e-services under the NeGP. Research & Development (R & D) in the emerging areas of Geo Information Science and Technology are promoted to continually upgrade the tools and techniques. Some of the thrust areas for R & D include Geo-spatial Cloud Computing, Geo-Service Chaining, Geo-visualisation and Computer Cartography, Geo-Semantic Web, Spatio-temporal Data Modelling, Uncertainty in Geo-Spatial Data, Analytical/Process Modelling and Spatial Data Handling (SDI) etc. Specialized research and training centres are being set up in different parts of the country to facilitate capacity building.Sharing of spatial data by data providing agencies in the framework of Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) is an essential requirement in e-services delivery. District and state geo-portal prototypes have been developed using OGC/ISO specifications and their utility demonstrated to end user agencies. Specific studies have been completed in areas like Cartographic Generalization, Enterprise GIS, and Sensor Web Enablement etc. in order to demonstrate the utility of web-based geo-spatial data processing tools in e-Governance service delivery. In a typical district or a state, different line departments and agencies acquire and process spatial data sets for field/local level applications. Some of these data sets relate to watersheds, plots, weather, irrigation, health, education etc. Inadequate access to these data sets inhibits their use and integration with other relevant layers. The geo-portals are being upgraded with metadata from the line departments to facilitate discovery of geo-spatial data by using catalogue service on web (CSW). The geo-portals have been made accessible through the single window access mechanism of the India Geo Portal of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI).In order to provide map service on the web for a city area primarily consisting of features like buildings and roads, there is a need for generalizing features by removing unnecessary details. Cartographic generalization plays an important role in overcoming these effects and preserves the required legibility considering the need for communicating (maps) geographical data to mobile devices in support of delivery of e-services.In the coming years, NRDMS will gear itself towards covering application sectors like 'Sustainable Agriculture' and 'Disaster Management', and engaging stakeholders attention in the development and utilization of geo-spatial data processing tools and technologies in different real-life applications."

It develops a vision of an 'open governance framework', moving beyond 'new public management', based on ICT-enabled societal-wide collaboration. It recognises that although the public sector can in principle create public value on its own, its potential to do so is greatly enhanced and extended by direct cooperation with other actors, or by facilitating public value creation by other actors on their own. It also examines the role of bottom-up innovation and public policy experimentation, as well as the need to focus on empowering civil servants and changing public sector working practices and mindsets."

In order to support such process, CITY FEED supports all levels of the maturity framework (publishing, transacting, interacting, collaborating, and evaluating) and integrates related information relationally and heterogeneously. In order to integrate heterogeneous information, it implements a threefold feed deduplication mechanism based on the geographic, text semantic, and image similarities of feeds.

By utilizing social media, citizen science projects can potentially engage many participants to contribute their observations covering a large geographic region and over a long time period. This is an improvement, for example, over traditional biodiversity surveys which typically involve relatively few people in confined regions and periods.As social media is not designed for scientific data collection and analysis, there is a problem in transferring unstructured information items (e.g. free-form text, unidentified images, etc.) often found in social media to structured data records for scientific tasks. To help bridge this gap, we propose an approach comprised of three steps: (1) Information Extraction, (2) Information Formalization, and (3) Information Reuse. We apply this approach to processing posts and comments from two Facebook interest groups on species observations. Our study demonstrates that with principled methods and proper tools, crowdsourced social media contents such as those from Facebook interest groups can be used for collaborative species identification and occurrence."

The stated goals of JCPM are to establish a place for individuals who identify themselves as disenfranchised to discuss and take action on issues of social and economic policy in the US. JCPM is one example of hundreds of issue-based organizations emerging on Facebook worldwide. Since its inception in January 2010, over 344,000 Facebook members have become followers of the JCPM page. Our analysis of the text of the discourse and the social networks, which emerge on the JCPM page, show three surprising results. First, in contrast to prior studies, significant deliberative discourse among members emerges in this open, public space without prompting. Second, the discourse practices and structure that emerge on the JCPM Facebook page show two types of leadership: Centralized, organizational leadership, and decentralized leadership from participants. Third, we identify two structural characteristics of this virtual political organization using social network analysis of trace data: a) Organizational leaders are not central to discussions of controversial topics; b) Advocacy and dissent behavior in the discussions are reflected in the social network structure. Our findings have implications for the practices and technology designs used to engage citizens through social and participatory media."

Still, they mostly show passive content such as commercials and digital signage. At the same time, technological advances have enabled the creation of interactive displays potentially increasing their attractiveness for the audience, e.g. through providing a platform for civic discourse. This poses considerable challenges, since displays need to communicate the opportunity to engage, motivate the audience to do so, and be easy to use. In this paper we present Vote With Your Feet, a hyperlocal public polling tool for urban screens allowing users to express their opinions. Similar to vox populi interviews on TV or polls on news websites, the tool is meant to reflect the mindset of the community on topics such as current affairs, cultural identity and local matters. It is novel in that it focuses on a situated civic discourse and provides a tangible user interface, tackling the mentioned challenges. It shows one Yes/No question at a time and enables users to vote by stepping on one of two tangible buttons on the ground. This user interface was introduced to attract people's attention and to lower participation barriers. Our field study showed that Vote With Your Feet is perceived as inviting and that it can spark discussions among co-located people."

Intercultural competence involves awareness of the differences between cultures, knowledge about the beliefs, values, and practices of other cultures, and the skill to apply that knowledge effortlessly and effectively in interpersonal interactions. Acquiring intercultural competence can involve intensive study of the target culture, as well as immersion in social milieu of the target culture. Anyone who interacts regularly with people of other cultures can benefit from intercultural competence, but not everyone has the time and motivation to engage in lengthy cultural study, or the opportunity to immerse oneself in the other culture for extended periods.The focus of this talk is on the role of learning technologies in promoting intercultural competence. We address the problem of intercultural competence by means of computer-based serious games designed to help learners quickly acquire job-related linguistic and cultural proficiency. Videogame technology is used to create virtual worlds populated by non-player characters that speak and understand the target language, and behave in accordance with the norms of the culture. Conversational artificial intelligence technology enables learners to engage in spoken conversations with the non-player characters. Learners must speak the target language, and behave in a culturally proficient manner, in order to succeed at the game. cultural knowledge and skills, and organize them into curricula that serve as the basis for the game-based courses. Curriculum design focuses on the situations that learners are likely to encounter when interacting with people from the target culture, and tasks that they are likely to want to perform. This context provides a Cultural Lens that focuses curriculum development on the locations, socio-political factors, perspectives, and cultural practices that are most relevant to those situations and tasks. This approach results in courses that enable people to quickly acquire the intercultural skills that are most relevant to their particular needs. In the process they gain enhanced cultural awareness, which can support learners and motivate them to broaden and deepen their knowledge of the target culture. Military personnel engaged in civil affairs and peacekeeping operations are making extensive use of Alelo courses prior to overseas deployments. They report that the linguistic and cultural competence that they gained from the courses had a significant impact on the effectiveness of their operations. For example, a US Marine unit recently reported that it completed a tour of duty in Iraq without a single combat casualty. It attributed its success to its enhanced ability to develop relationships and establish rapport with the local people. We are currently developing a variety of other courses aimed at linguistic and cultural competence. Encounters: Global Chinese is an integrated course in Chinese language and culture, being developed in collaboration with Yale University Press and Chinese International Publishing Group. Rez World, developed in collaboration with Thornton Media, is designed to promote language and culture restoration among Native American tribes. A Web-based course for Voice of America is intended to provide VOA listeners worldwide with an opportunity to develop spoken English communication skills and develop a better understanding of American culture."

Harvesting and analysing data gathered in response to personal or local enquiries can be seen as an antidote to information provided by official sources. Democratising sensing means that ordinary people can learn about and understand the world around them better and can be a part of the decision-making in improving environments for all. In this paper, we review and describe participatory sensing and discuss this in relation to making a series of prototype tools and applications for mobile users--Located Lexicon, Where's Fenton? and Tall Buildings. In the first of these projects, Located Lexicon, we wanted to find out whether a lexicon of terms derived from user-generated content could enable the formation of Twitter like groups that allow users to engage in finding out more about their location. In the second project, Where's Fenton? we made a publicly available app that involves users in counting the abundance and logging the location of deer in a park. This project focused specifically on anonymity of the user in collecting data for a specific enquiry. In the last project, Tall Buildings, we experimented with using dimensions of altitude, distance and speed to encourage users to physically explore a city from its rooftops. In all of these projects, we experiment with the pedestrian as a human sensor and the methods and roles they may engage in to make new discoveries. The underlying premise for our work is that it is not possible to calibrate people to be identical, so experimenting with crowd-sourced data opens up thinking about the way we observe and learn about the physical environment."

A central tenet of Participatory Design (PD) is the direct involvement of people in the co-design of things and technologies they use and live with. The Participatory Design Conference continues to be the main gathering point of the PD community and an important venue for international discussion of the collaborative, social, and political dimensions of technology innovation and use. Held every two years since 1990, the conference has helped to broaden participatory approaches in design around a variety of arenas, including information and communication technologies, computer supported cooperative work, healthcare, learning, new media and digital culture, community settings, architecture and the urban environment, the arts, visual communication, interaction design and service design to mention some of the fields involved.In the same spirit of past editions, PDC 2014 brings together a multidisciplinary and international group of researchers, practitioners, activists and citizens who both advocate and adopt distinctively participatory approaches. For 2014 the theme selected for the call for papers was ""Reflecting Connectedness"". The call invited contributors to recognise principles of relationships between people, things and their environment, beyond participation -- a theme that suits very well to be dealt with in Windhoek, Namibia, our host city this year. By 'reflecting connectedness' in participatory design, the organizing committee wants to acknowledge the influential relations across continents, societies, people, disciplines and time, beyond the direct involvement of stakeholders. The contributions of these proceedings thus aim at highlighting ways in which the value of accumulated experiences in PD and elsewhere over time enrich the field of Participatory Design. The papers presented here also engage in critical debates on what it means to design within and for multilayered networks."

From these data, we constructed partisan alignments based on hashtag usage and retweet networks. We found evidence of more stark political polarization in the French case, while the US case demonstrated less partisan division. This study elaborates commonalities and contrasts in the use of a major social medium by citizens in contexts that differ in political culture and language but feature similar ideological divides, electoral politics, and campaign contexts.

Soc.,June 2015,45,2,,July,2015,0095-2737,,,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA","Why develop educational practices involving computing for the social good? Does the field of ethics provide a viable framework for assessing an evaluating such practices? And are projects that involve students in computing for the social good efficacious in the formation of ethical computing professionals? At Carnegie Mellon, we have developed practices to involve a significant number of students in software development projects and consulting engagements for the social good. A consulting course has had over 500 community service-learning engagements in 18 years, and in a software development capstone course our yearly cohort of 60 students work in small teams to develop software for 15+ social service organizations. Our practices have evolved out of our shared vision of what makes a good computing professional, but we would now like to better define, assess, and communicate what the vision is.The NSF has a program solicitation (15-528) entitled Cultivating Cultures for Ethical STEM (CCE STEM) that ""funds research projects that identify factors that are efficacious in the formation of ethical STEM researchers in all the fields of science and engineering that NSF supports."" It asks: ""What constitutes ethical STEM research and practice? Which cultural and institutional contexts promote ethical STEM research and practice and why?"" Among the factors they mention are ""curricula ... that stress social responsibility and humanitarian goals""; i.e. computing for the social good. And ""what practices contribute to the establishment and maintenance of ethical cultures and how can these practices be transferred, extended to, and integrated into other research and learning settings?""To provide some context from my experience, there are two prevalent types of computing-for-the-social-good projects:1. System-based: Projects that address a social-good (e.g. disaster management, public accountability, or medical record management) and are generally released to the public as open source projects (e.g. Sahana, Ushahidi, or OpenMRS).2. Client-based: Projects that custom-build a solution for a nonprofit, school, international NGO, or other social-good organization. For example, helping a nonprofit increase fundraising with a website, or a school improve interaction with its students using a course management system. Often, but not always, these solutions use the open source projects in (1), but in all cases the solution involves much more work than fetching the software.Our consulting and capstone project course use the client-based model. When done well, client-based social-good projects have the potential to enrich student learning in ambiguous real world environments. Students report increased confidence, further development of technical skills, a sense of satisfaction and appreciation for the needs of their partner organizations.Delivery of a tangible benefit to partner organizations is also generally an expected outcome. Providing lasting value to community partners should, in practice, be a key objective of any serious client engagement. However too often, the needs, concerns and ultimate outcomes for community partners are often overlooked or forgotten. Solutions that are incomplete, poorly implemented, poorly documented, inappropriate to the problem at hand or simply unsustainable may provide little or no value to community partners. In fact, these solutions may actually be detrimental to partner organizations.There is significant risk, therefore, that benefits to ICT service learning projects are asymmetric; students generally report significant benefits from the experience, but community based partners may, in fact, find the experience expensive, risky, and potentially harmful to their missions, organizations and employees. Many community partners simply do not have the resources to finish incomplete projects, sustain or maintain complex software or systems, or perform needed application or server administration.We use a capacity-building model of working with a community partner. This is not the let-us-buildyou-a-system model, where students develop and drop in (often unsustainable) technology solutions. Rather, it emphasizes working-with, and weaving solutions into the development partner's organization, building their capacity to not only use, but to maintain and evolve their solutions as their needs grow and change.Returning to the bigger question of cultivating a culture of ethical practice, these classes are meant to model an ethic of care in meeting the needs of a nonprofit client whose mission is the social good.They expose students to issues of:- Being truthful in working with the client: not misrepresenting their capabilities nor the robustness of their solution.- Being respectful and not misusing the client's time and other resources.- Not taking advantage of their team mates via slacking and free-loading.- Safeguarding the privacy and confidentiality of citizen information in any system they build, and including controls that maintain appropriate privacy and confidentiality.- Not misappropriating software, being aware of licenses, and attributing borrowed work that is otherwise not licensed.- Understanding the role of nonprofit organizations in society. How they are similar and different from for-profit corporations. How they contribute to the social good where markets would not otherwise serve.The NSF solicitation provides an opportunity to support looking at both why we do computing for the social good, and whether these educational practices develop computing professionals who are more aware of the ethical dimensions of their work. The solicitation encourages a comparison across institutions; is SIGCAS a good nexus for building that collaboration?As part of the SIGCAS Symposium, the author shared practices in the consulting and software development capstone courses, and the nascent evaluation ideas they are piloting. A goal is to get others' feedback and explore possibilities for collaboration."

However, deeply ingrained beliefs, social systems, and cultural practices, combined with a lack of knowledge of the disease, made containment difficult. IBM Research - Africa, in collaboration with Sierra Leone Open Government Initiative (OGI), set up a call and SMS hotline to engage with citizens and understand issues on the ground using free text responses, which started on 19th Sept 2014 (during the first national lockdown). Localized versions of Centre for Disease Control (CDC) public health messages were broadcast on public radio along with a short question on Ebola, and listeners were encouraged to call or SMS the OGI hotline in reply to the question, or to report the current situation in their locality. Messages were categorized using a basic keyword search approach, based on categories that were determined manually, and the results of the analysis were communicated to the government via OGI. The initial deployment showed the potential of using a 2-way communication platform utilizing natural language responses to provide valuable feedback on behaviors and attitudes during a health emergency. Our presentation will describe the original platform, the outcomes of the analysis performed to date and the current work being undertaken to extend and scale the platform in Sierra Leone."

Approaching the 26th anniversary of the CSCW conference, we were asked to move the submission deadline two months earlier to reduce the reviewing conflict with CHI 2012. In response, we used the additional time to innovate and to increase participation while maintaining or increasing quality, by allowing authors to revise and resubmit their papers and notes. Conference attendees and proceedings readers will ultimately assess the outcome, but overall the feedback from associate chairs, reviewers and authors has been very positive.Submissions increased 57% from CSCW 2011 to a record 290 papers and 125 notes. We increased the program committee to 67 associate chairs (ACs) to handle them; 21 were women and 20 were from outside North America. They comprised representatives from computer science, social media and social networks, psychology, anthropology, software engineering, management, and design. Fifty were from universities.Our process most resembled a journal special issue, with a submission deadline, a team of four reviewers, and one revision cycle under a firm time constraint (in this case five weeks). Each submission was assigned to two committee members, designated AC-Coordinator and ACReviewer. Each AC assigned one external reviewer. In the first round, each paper or note was blind-reviewed by the AC-Reviewer and the two external reviewers. Reviewers assessed the likelihood that it could be revised within one month to be acceptable. Based on the outcomes, submissions were considered 'conditional accept' (CA, 8.7%), 'revise=resubmit' (RR, 46.5%) or 'reject' (44.8%). In general, papers that received one or more positive assessments were offered the opportunity to revise.Papers that had no positive assessment in the first round were rejected. We based this decision on an analysis of CSCW 2011 data, which revealed that submissions that did not get an advocate in the initial reviewing had 0% chance of acceptance. Sixty percent of CSCW 2011 submissions had no advocate, compared to 45% of CSCW 2012 submissions. The difference is that the CSCW 2012 submissions had a month in which they could be improved. By immediately rejecting the 45% that had no chance, we streamlined and focused the process, and reduced the number of reviews per submission despite the revision cycle.The AC Coordinator relied on the reviews in providing written guidance to authors on how to revise RRs. Authors of RR and CA submissions had five weeks to prepare a revision and an explanation of how they had addressed reviewer concerns. Resubmissions of RRs underwent a full second review from the same four-reviewer team; most CAs were checked by just one AC. Reviewing teams were strongly encouraged to resolve decisions prior to the program committee meeting and indeed, only 6% of initial submissions had to be discussed in the meeting.The program committee split into two subgroups followed by a plenary session to make the final decisions. 127 papers and 37 notes, 39.5% of initial submissions, reached acceptable quality through revision. This is almost twice the number presented in any previous CSCW, in part due to record submissions. ACs and reviewers nominated papers and notes for consideration for Best Paper awards; 4 were selected, with 17 awarded Honorable Mention.The accepted work represents diverse topics. Relatively new topics for CSCW include crowdsourcing, civic engagement, and social media; more traditional CSCW topics include distributed work, coordination, ethnography, and collaborative software development.This collaborative effort was an example of computer supported cooperative work. The entire CSCW community provided input throughout the process-many ideas and changes came from outside of the committee. Committee members had to adapt to new ways of working. Our analysis indicates that the work required of reviewers and associate chairs did not exceed that of past years, and authors benefited from two rounds of feedback from committed ACs and reviewers.Our goal was to maintain a high quality threshold while enabling more papers to reach that threshold. We believe there are many benefits to a review process with more opportunity for constructive interaction between reviewers and authors. Authors benefit by learning more about the CSCW culture, and by producing papers that are better than they could have produced on their own. Reviewers benefit by seeing their work lead to improved papers. The community benefits, because more of its members are successful at producing high quality research each year.As a community, we must consider new ways to assess conference quality-when a larger volume of high quality work is produced, older metrics no longer hold. Considering the fraction of submitted work that is of low quality to be a measure of conference quality is backwards. We need new measures of process quality and the resulting quality of accepted work. Through continued innovation, CSCW will remain the top venue for leading edge research on collaboration and technology. As with any new process, mistakes were made and much was learned. We look forward to participating as community members in ongoing innovation.The other technical tracks contribute immeasurably to the program. A record number of interactive posters will be presented. The 14 workshops drew a remarkable number of submissions. With demos, horizon, panels, videos, special sessions, and three plenary keynotes, CSCW 2012 is a great start to the second quarter-century of the CSCW conference."

Today 'users' have become a component in mass-market production and are seen as 'customers', rather than people. Still designers need to address use, and personas have been introduced for this purpose. The paper uses research on user participation and research-based personas from the eGov+ project to discuss whether personas help designers engage with users. In this project, design was carried out in the domain of municipal services through involvement of clerks, management and citizens from three different municipalities. Through four cases we discuss if applying personas in participatory design settings is productive to designers' understanding of users' use situations. Does deployment of personas bring designers closer to the actual use situation? In which ways do personas help design for, with or by the users? Do personas support participatory design?"

Approaching the 26th anniversary of the CSCW conference, we were asked to move the submission deadline two months earlier to reduce the reviewing conflict with CHI 2012. In response, we used the additional time to innovate and to increase participation while maintaining or increasing quality, by allowing authors to revise and resubmit their papers and notes. Conference attendees and proceedings readers will ultimately assess the outcome, but overall the feedback from associate chairs, reviewers and authors has been very positive.Submissions increased 57% from CSCW 2011 to a record 290 papers and 125 notes. We increased the program committee to 67 associate chairs (ACs) to handle them; 21 were women and 20 were from outside North America. They comprised representatives from computer science, social media and social networks, psychology, anthropology, software engineering, management, and design. Fifty were from universities.Our process most resembled a journal special issue, with a submission deadline, a team of four reviewers, and one revision cycle under a firm time constraint (in this case five weeks). Each submission was assigned to two committee members, designated AC-Coordinator and ACReviewer. Each AC assigned one external reviewer. In the first round, each paper or note was blind-reviewed by the AC-Reviewer and the two external reviewers. Reviewers assessed the likelihood that it could be revised within one month to be acceptable. Based on the outcomes, submissions were considered 'conditional accept' (CA, 8.7%), 'revise=resubmit' (RR, 46.5%) or 'reject' (44.8%). In general, papers that received one or more positive assessments were offered the opportunity to revise.Papers that had no positive assessment in the first round were rejected. We based this decision on an analysis of CSCW 2011 data, which revealed that submissions that did not get an advocate in the initial reviewing had 0% chance of acceptance. Sixty percent of CSCW 2011 submissions had no advocate, compared to 45% of CSCW 2012 submissions. The difference is that the CSCW 2012 submissions had a month in which they could be improved. By immediately rejecting the 45% that had no chance, we streamlined and focused the process, and reduced the number of reviews per submission despite the revision cycle.The AC Coordinator relied on the reviews in providing written guidance to authors on how to revise RRs. Authors of RR and CA submissions had five weeks to prepare a revision and an explanation of how they had addressed reviewer concerns. Resubmissions of RRs underwent a full second review from the same four-reviewer team; most CAs were checked by just one AC. Reviewing teams were strongly encouraged to resolve decisions prior to the program committee meeting and indeed, only 6% of initial submissions had to be discussed in the meeting.The program committee split into two subgroups followed by a plenary session to make the final decisions. 127 papers and 37 notes, 39.5% of initial submissions, reached acceptable quality through revision. This is almost twice the number presented in any previous CSCW, in part due to record submissions. ACs and reviewers nominated papers and notes for consideration for Best Paper awards; 4 were selected, with 17 awarded Honorable Mention.The accepted work represents diverse topics. Relatively new topics for CSCW include crowdsourcing, civic engagement, and social media; more traditional CSCW topics include distributed work, coordination, ethnography, and collaborative software development.This collaborative effort was an example of computer supported cooperative work. The entire CSCW community provided input throughout the process-many ideas and changes came from outside of the committee. Committee members had to adapt to new ways of working. Our analysis indicates that the work required of reviewers and associate chairs did not exceed that of past years, and authors benefited from two rounds of feedback from committed ACs and reviewers.Our goal was to maintain a high quality threshold while enabling more papers to reach that threshold. We believe there are many benefits to a review process with more opportunity for constructive interaction between reviewers and authors. Authors benefit by learning more about the CSCW culture, and by producing papers that are better than they could have produced on their own. Reviewers benefit by seeing their work lead to improved papers. The community benefits, because more of its members are successful at producing high quality research each year.As a community, we must consider new ways to assess conference quality-when a larger volume of high quality work is produced, older metrics no longer hold. Considering the fraction of submitted work that is of low quality to be a measure of conference quality is backwards. We need new measures of process quality and the resulting quality of accepted work. Through continued innovation, CSCW will remain the top venue for leading edge research on collaboration and technology. As with any new process, mistakes were made and much was learned. We look forward to participating as community members in ongoing innovation.The other technical tracks contribute immeasurably to the program. A record number of interactive posters will be presented. The 14 workshops drew a remarkable number of submissions. With demos, horizon, panels, videos, special sessions, and three plenary keynotes, CSCW 2012 is a great start to the second quarter-century of the CSCW conference."

Such applications are sought to sense the quality of the environment thus enabling authorities to promote safety and well-being among citizens. However, little is known about how users perceive incident reporting systems and which factors affect the user experience (UX) and the perception of risk. In this paper we present some lessons learned from an empirical study involving twenty users engaged in reporting urban incidents using a mobile application. A significant result from the present study is to point out how and which UX dimensions can be effectively used as triggers to motivate users to report incidents. Based on citizens' perception of urban incidents, we discuss how to build innovative incident reporting systems that can improve the communication between citizens and administrations."

Rulemaking is one of the U. S. government's most important policymaking methods. Although broad transparency and participation rights are part of its legal structure, significant barriers prevent effective engagement by many groups of interested citizens. Regulation Room, an experimental open-government partnership between academic researchers and government agencies, is a socio-technical participation system that uses multiple methods to lower potential barriers to broader participation. To encourage effective individual comments and productive group discussion in Regulation Room, we adapt strategies for facilitative human moderation originating from social science research in deliberative democracy and alternative dispute resolution [24, 1, 18, 14] for use in the demanding online participation setting of eRulemaking. We develop a moderation protocol, deploy it in ""live"" Department of Transportation (DOT) rulemakings, and provide an initial analysis of its use through a manual coding of all moderator interventions with respect to the protocol. We then investigate the feasibility of automating the moderation protocol: we employ annotated data from the coding project to train machine learning-based classifiers to identify places in the online discussion where human moderator intervention is required. Though the trained classifiers only marginally outperform the baseline, the improvement is statistically significant in spite of limited data and a very basic feature set, which is a promising result."

The goal is to create the socio-technical conditions for transferring the ability to develop web-based government-to-citizen services from software professionals to administrative personnel. To this end, proper end-user development techniques should be defined by capturing and exploiting employees' best practices and expertise. With reference to a typical government service, the paper reports summary results from a study of administrative personnel work practices and explores employees' motivations to become end-user software developers. It then outlines the design pattern language we have been defining for the considered domain to represent, from the employees' point of view, the problems encountered while creating government services together with their possible solutions. This is the starting point for identifying a further language that addresses the problem of end-user development of e-government services from an interaction-design point of view. These pattern languages can be regarded as metadesign tools for end-user development whose final aim is to support, and even improve, existing best practices in service creation, thus increasing employees' motivation and engagement in end-user development activities."

Open government data initiatives generally begin with a directive or a policy followed by a setting up of a data portal. All government agencies under the jurisdiction are then advised to contribute datasets in open format on the data portal. These contributing agencies face a lot of challenge right from understanding open data, capacity to compile good quality data, technology integration, potential apps, availability of funds and allocation of duty to institutional support. There is a need to enable and equip these government agencies with necessary skillsets to contribute high quality datasets. Departments also need to be equipped with necessary technology & administrative support to engage with Citizens willing to use data in open domain. Effective collaboration with community is also necessary to achieve potential use of datasets released.

During a two year period (Aug 2010 - Dec 2012), while violence was on the rise in these regions, our findings show a decline in negative emotional expression as well as a rise in emotional arousal and dominance in Twitter posts: aspects known to be psychological markers of desensitization.

Society and economy has become more interconnected, unstable and unpredictable than ever, and citizens are keener to engage in complex policy making. Within this context, traditional tools for policy making, based upon the perfectly rational representative agent maximizing its own utility in a general equilibrium framework, have been demonstrated to be unable to predict and cope with some of today's most pressing challenges, such as the financial crisis and climate change. Despite the explosion of data availability, the possibility to analyse them through crowdsourcing and large scale collaboration, the advance in modelling and simulation tools for assessing non-linear impact of policy options, the full potential offered by the new instruments for policy making has yet to be achieved. Therefore policy makers have not yet at their disposal a set of instruments able to cope with the needs stemming from their decision making activities.In order to meet those needs the project CROSSOVER ""Bridging Communities for Next Generation Policy-Making"" is elaborating a demand/driven ""International Research Roadmap on ICT tools for Governance and Policy Modelling"", which links the needs and the activities of policy-making with current and future research challenges."

Adapting from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), this exploratory study examines senior citizens' perceptions of the Nintendo Wii. Twenty-eight participants took part in this pilot study conducted at a senior citizens centre in Singapore. Data collection was carried out via a self-reported questionnaire and video observation. Findings indicate that senior citizens perceived the Nitindo Wii usable with realistic depictions of games and had positive engagement with the Wii games. However, contrary to prior belief, findings did not show that perceived usefulness has a significant influence on senior citizens' intention to use the Wii for improving social interaction, health and exercise.

Airborne networking has emerged as an important research discipline over the past few years. This workshop series is created to encouragefundamental as well as applied research in this important domain. It is a result of the ideas that emerged from the meetings held over the past several years on topics that focused on cyber-physical systems (CPS) for transportation. We believe that this workshop gives us an opportunity to discuss state-of-the-art, share our research results with our peers, and develop directions for future research in this emerging field.Research and development work in airborne networking and communications has been limited to military domain until a few years ago. However, over the past few years, the industry, federal organizations, and universities have started exploring the civilian applications of aerial networks, especially networks involving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). UAVs have already proven to be efficient and economical in many applications including border and port surveillance, earth and atmospheric studies, monitoring events such as forest fires, protecting critical infrastructure, and environmental monitoring, among others. With the proposed integration of UAS into National Airspace System (NAS) by FAA, numerous other civilian applications including pipeline patrol, law enforcement, cargo delivery, border patrol, and critical infrastructure protection are being envisioned. The use of UAS leads to significant cost benefits in such applications.Before UAS can be deployed in the civilian airspace, there are significant challenges that we as a research community need to tackle. Enhancing situational awareness, sense and avoid, safety and security capabilities, and improving vehicle autonomy are the most important among these challenges as discussed in the recent workshop on Transportation CPS that was held in January 2014. In addition, as emphasized in the same workshop, there is also a need for experimental flight tests to demonstrate the safety and security of people in heavily populated areas.During this workshop, we will hear from researchers around the world who are currently engaged in research activities related to airborne networking and communications. The topics include experimental test-beds, routing protocols in tactical airborne networking, and exploring data mule concepts in UAV swarms. The papers showcase the state of the art in UAV networking and communications, demonstrate the challenges in designing real-world applications involving airborne networking and communications. We encourage the readers to take a look at the special issue of IEEE Communications Magazine on enabling next-generation airborne communications that was published in May 2014."
